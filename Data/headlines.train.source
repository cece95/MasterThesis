WASHINGTON(Reuters) - The Trump administration is drafting a legal blueprint for mining on the moon under a new U.S.-sponsored international agreement called the Artemis Accords, people familiar with the proposed pact told Reuters.The agreement would be the latest effort to cultivate allies around NASA’s plan to put humans and space stations on the moon within the next decade, and comes as the civilian space agency plays a growing role in implementing American foreign policy. The draft pact has not been formally shared with U.S. allies yet.The Trump administration and other spacefaring countries see the moon as a key strategic asset in outer space. The moon also has value for long-term scientific research that could enable future missions to Mars - activities that fall under a regime of international space law widely viewed as outdated.The Artemis Accords, named after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s new Artemis moon program, propose “safety zones” that would surround future moon bases to prevent damage or interference from rival countries or companies operating in close proximity.The pact also aims to provide a framework under international law for companies to own the resources they mine, the sources said.In the coming weeks, U.S. officials plan to formally negotiate the accords with space partners such as Canada, Japan, and European countries, as well as the United Arab Emirates, opening talks with countries the Trump administration sees as having “like-minded” interests in lunar mining.Russia, a major partner with NASA on the International Space Station, won’t be an early partner in these accords, the sources said, as the Pentagon increasingly views Moscow as hostile for making “threatening” satellite maneuvers toward U.S. spy satellites in Earth orbit. The United States is a member of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and sees the “safety zones” as an implementation of one of its highly debated articles. It states that celestial bodies and the moon are “not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”“This isn’t some territorial claim,” said one source, who requested anonymity to discuss the agreement. The safety zones - whose size would vary depending on the operation - would allow for coordination between space actors without technically claiming territory as sovereign, he said.“The idea is if you are going to be coming near someone’s operations, and they’ve declared safety zones around it, then you need to reach out to them in advance, consult and figure out how you can do that safely for everyone.”ARTEMIS AS ‘NATIONAL POWER’The Artemis Accords are part of the Trump administration’s plan to forgo the treaty process at the United Nations and instead reach agreement with “like-minded nations,” partly because a treaty process would take too long and working with non-spacefaring states would be unproductive, a senior administration official told Reuters.As countries increasingly treat space as a new military domain, the U.S.-led agreement is also emblematic of NASA’s growing role as a tool of American diplomacy and is expected to stoke controversy among Washington’s space rivals such as China.“NASA’s all about science and technology and discovery, which are critically important, but I think less salient is the idea that NASA is a tool of diplomacy,” NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said Tuesday.“The important thing is, countries all around the world want to be a part of this. That’s the element of national power,” Bridenstine said, adding that participation in the Artemis program is contingent on countries adhering to “norms of behavior that we expect to see” in space.NASA is investing tens of billions of dollars into the Artemis program, which calls for putting humans on the moon by 2024 and building up a “sustainable presence” on the lunar south pole thereafter, with private companies mining lunar rocks and subsurface water that can be converted to rocket fuel. The United States enacted a law in 2015 granting companies the property rights to resources they mine in outer space, but no such laws exist in the international community.Joanne Gabrynowicz, editor-in-chief emerita of the Journal of Space Law, said an international agreement must come before staking out “some kind of exclusive area for science or for whatever reason.”“It is not anything any nation can do unilaterally and still have it be legal,” she said.

These changes permit United to remove you solely based on its suspicion.In explaining these changes, a United spokesperson exclusively told TPG that “this update was made to help us better protect the health and safety of our customers and crew, and was made in line with our new requirement that all United employees and passengers wear a face covering while onboard the aircraft that went into effect May 4”.It’ll be interesting to see how (and if) these new changes take effect. Perhaps the carrier is setting itself up to have a legal basis to deny carriage to those who don’t submit themselves to airport coronavirus testing.As airlines look to recover from the pandemic, they’re attempting to reassure the flying public that it’s once again safe to take to the skies. Mandated, on-the-spot coronavirus testing could become a thing of the future, much like airport security.Emirates has already implemented COVID-19 testing on select flights. Passengers are all screened before departure to ensure that no one onboard is carrying the virus.Additionally, many countries don’t want to see a second wave of coronavirus cases. For instance, Austria has a policy that states that arriving passengers must go into a 14-day quarantine if they don’t present a health certificate showing a negative COVID-19 test result that’s no more than four days old. If you don’t have a recent COVID-19 test, the Vienna airport now offers on-demand testing to help you avoid a quarantine.As United begins to ramp up international travel, some of its destinations may require COVID-19 testing. The update to the Contract of Carriage allows the carrier to require such testing in order to be permitted to board, even if the carrier only has “reason to believe” you might carry the disease.This wasn’t the only change to be included in the Contract of Carriage. United also formalized its face covering mandate by adding a clause to the list of passengers that it can refuse:Passengers who refuse to wear a mask or face covering while at the airport and/or onboard UA and United Express flights if UA or United Express believe, in their sole discretion, that a failure to wear such a mask or facial covering may pose a risk to the health or safety of others.All in all, we’re living in unprecedented times. It might not be too long before you’re required to take a COVID-19 test in order to board a United flight. 
Are you considering selling your company as a potential exit? Now? A year from now? Five years from now? In more than 20 years of startup, with over a dozen acquisitions under my belt as an entrepreneur, advisor and investor, I can assure you that an acquisition is always a massive and complex transaction that you’re never 100% prepared for. In fact, the one regret I hear over and over again from my peers is that they got less than what they should have when they signed the deal.Whether you’re a founder or just have some equity, there’s a bunch of stuff you need to know before you decide to sell your startup, stuff that you won’t actually learn until you’ve been through it.I sat down with a friend last week who is in the position to seriously consider selling her company. It’s her first startup, so we went over a high-level outline of the process. Then I added a bunch of notes from my own experience for this post. How to know when it’s time to sellThere are basically four reasons to sell your company.Things are going poorly. This obviously isn’t good, and unless you’re in a position where you have to sell, I would recommend against it. Instead, I’d do everything in my power to stabilize and reconsider later.Things are going extremely well. On the other side, this is the best position to be in, but it’s also the time when the founders are least interested in selling. The deal has to be outstanding.An external factor. Something has happened outside of the company that has made selling an attractive option. For example, I wound up running two companies at the same time, and decided to get out of the small one to focus on the big one.You’ve taken it as far as you can. This is most often the primary reason why founders choose to sell their company. They see a lot of opportunity down the road, and decide that a specific acquirer can take much better advantage of that opportunity.Usually, the decision to sell is based on a combination of these reasons.How to make the decision to sellThere are basically three ways to get acquired.A larger company. This is someone in your space or close to it. To them, your company represents either an advance in innovation or just a bunch of new customers. This is the most popular option.Private equity. These firms usually buy out all of the existing owners and investors and may put company leadership on a profit plan to keep them around and motivated. These transactions usually happen at high levels of valuation, like approaching the billions.A new investment round. At lower levels of valuation, the same kind of transaction can take place where a new investor or group of investors buys out all of the current owners and investors.There are two things you need to do before you decide to sell. First, consider your negotiating position from strongest to weakest. Ideally, you should already have at least one offer on the table, or have rejected one or more offers in the recent past. This is the strongest position, as one offer usually attracts more offers.If you don’t have a solid offer, you should at least be investigating one or more implied offers. These hints and clues will come from partners, customers, competition, even investors and advisors with connections to other investors and PE firms. If you have none of these, selling the company is going to be a lot more difficult, but not impossible. In this case, acquisition is a lot like fundraising. If you don’t have any offers or leads, you need to build connections and relationships. You’re basically putting together a pitch deck and going door to door. If you’re not patient, you’ll end up giving up a lot of value on your equity.You might also consider bringing in a fixer, an experienced person who will come in as CEO for a large chunk of equity and get your company into a better position to sell, both operationally and in terms of connections. I rarely see this work, but I have indeed seen it work. Here, you’re trading shares for the hopes of increased value of those shares. Finally, you might find private money that just wants to take over your company. These transactions happen at much lower valuations. Kind of a fire sale.  The second thing you need to do before you make the decision to sell is talk to your board, your current investors, your executive team, and your advisors. Everyone has to be in line, on board, and the proper expectations need to be set and agreed upon. Preparing the company to be soldThere are basically three ways to calculate the sale price of your company.A service-based company is usually valued at 1x to 2x annual revenue. In cases where the company is a hybrid of product or intellectual property that may be spun off, this can creep to 3x or maybe a little more.A product company is usually valued at 2x to 10x annual revenue, depending on the market for the product, the protected unique differentiators, the higher the tech, and a number of other things, usually related to opportunity.In cases of extreme opportunity and innovation, a product company can be sold for 20x to 50x.There are two things you’ll have to do to sell your company: Show you’re worth the sale price and prove the legitimacy of your operation.To show your worth, if your company is taking in $10 million in revenue and your valuation comes out at 10x, or $100 million, you need to be able to show the acquirer the path to $100 million within a three- to five-year time frame. The more objectively you can show that return, the more likely you’ll get your asking price.There are a number of ways you can do this, but spreadsheets and hockey-stick charts probably aren’t enough to open the checkbook. For example, in one case we had to actually conduct a one-month experimental project and hit certain milestones dictated by the acquirer. In another, we went through a three month period where we pushed the accelerator to the ground to show 100% month over month growth for three straight months. To prove your legitimacy, you’re going to have to go through due diligence. This will happen after an offer sheet has been put together and hopefully there’s a penalty clause if the buyer pulls out. During due diligence, you’ll have to show that the structural integrity of your company is clean. This means you’ll need to: Show a clean cap table, with all the equity in the company past, present, and future accounted for.Open your books so they can audit your financials.Sit your lawyers with their lawyers to sniff out liability and risk, and also make sure your intellectual property is properly protected.Interview and background check your management team to uncover skeletons in anyone’s closet. And also make sure everyone important will stay on.There will be no time between the initial interest from the acquirer and microscope time, so you’ll need to have all your ducks in a row before you put your company on the market.TimelineYour guess is as good as mine, so make your best guess, then double it.The fastest I’ve ever been through an acquisition deal was four months, the longest was seven months. Again, it’s like raising a funding round, so the shape your company and the strength of your negotiating position will determine a lot of the timeline, but there will always be external factors to deal with. For example, one time we had the buyer just drop off the face of the earth for 45 days. At about day 30 we resigned ourselves to the fact that it wasn’t going to happen. Then it did.Think 1–2 months to prepare and line up suitors, 2–3 months to get a solid offer in place, 1–2 months of due diligence. It is not quick, but it should not drag. Regardless of my anecdote above, both sides have an incentive to move quickly, it just takes time. Preparing yourself for life after startupThe last thing my friend and I talked about was what she was going to do once her startup was folded into a new company. Even from her early vantage point, in almost all outcomes, she was looking at a comfy VP position at a nice salary. She could do that. The question, of course, was for how long.The last time my company was acquired was the first time I planned to stick around to hit the next milestone. I didn’t make it. Two years in, I hit a wall that I never recovered from, even after a few more months of soul-searching. It was a mix of internal changes, external factors, and me just being done. I felt like I was dragging a bag of bricks to work every morning. I’d try to stick around again. I’ve never been one to hop from startup to startup, and I’ve been immersed enough in the corporate world to know I can navigate it. But there’s a reason they usually lock the executive team in for two years. That’s about all either side can take of the other. The thing is, because it was the first time I planned to stay put after the acquisition, I never developed a contingency plan going into the acquisition, and I paid for it afterwards. When I did leave, it took three months just to find my feet. I’ve seen other folks take way longer to decompress, and I’ve seen some of them do some crazy stuff along the way, like start that folly of a company they always wanted to start and now that they had the means to start it and no one to tell them no… disaster. So whether your plan is to stick around or run away screaming, make sure you build in time to think about what’s next. You can do whatever you want after that time, maybe start a new project, maybe take a new position. What you do might not even be startup-related at all.But chances are it will be. Entrepreneurs are like addicts; we don’t know when to quit.
A PROBE into how factors such as ethnicity and obesity can affect vulnerability to Covid-19 has been ordered by the Health Secretary.Deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups are said to be disproportionately high.It comes as Britain's ethnic minorities are suffering a vastly higher proportion of coronavirus deaths, figures show.Covid-19 has killed 33 white people per 100,000 in English hospitals but 89 per 100,000 of black Caribbean descent, says NHS England.A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies also showed deaths of British black Africans are 3.5 times those of white Brits, and Brit Pakistani deaths are 2.7 times higher.Speaking at the daily Downing Street press briefing on Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: "We recognise that there has been a disproportionately high number of people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds who have passed away especially among care workers and those in the NHS."Deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam, who said people would have noticed he was from an "ethnic minority group", added that the issue was being taken "incredibly seriously".Disproportionate numbers"We will get to the bottom of this however long it takes us," he said.Mr Hancock added that data has also shown there could be a relationship between obesity and the impact of Covid-19 on individuals.It comes after researchers at the University of Liverpool warned last week that obesity increased the risk of dying from the virus by 37 per cent.He added: "Our knowledge about this virus grows daily and it appears some groups are more affected than others."Emerging data from around the world suggests there could possibly be a relationship between obesity and the impact of Covid-19 on individuals."It's too early to say if obesity in itself is a factor or conditions associated with it – or there is not enough data yet to rule it out – so we need to approach any assumptions with caution."Every death from this virus is a tragedy and behind each statistic is a name, a loss and a family that will never be the same again."The review will analyse how factors such as ethnicity, gender and obesity can affect people's vulnerability to coronavirus.Public Health England (PHE) said thousands of health records of people who have had Covid-19 will be examined to establish more "robust" data on what can impact the number of cases and health outcomes for different groups within the population.The findings of the PHE-led review will be published at the end of the month.We owe it to the nation to find out how this virus may affect different groups in different waysMatt HancockHealth SecretaryMr Hancock said: "As part of our continued effort to reduce health inequalities, we have commissioned PHE to consider various factors such as obesity, ethnicity, age, gender and geographical location, and how these may have an impact on someone's susceptibility to the virus, including our brilliant key workers and frontline NHS and social care staff."It's an extremely important and hugely complex task, but we owe it to the nation to find out how this virus may affect different groups in different ways, to protect lives and limit the spread of the disease."PHE said available data on health outcomes for NHS staff will also be analysed to better understand how the virus affects frontline workers.The review will also look at vulnerable groups such as people who are homeless and rough sleeping, it added.It will be led by Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE public health director for London, who said: "Detailed and careful work is being done so that we can better understand this and explore the possible reasons for any disparities."Increasing evidence and concern around the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on black and minority ethnic groups highlights an important focus of this review."PHE is rapidly building robust data and undertaking detailed analysis to develop our understanding of the impact of this novel coronavirus on different groups which can inform actions to mitigate the risks it presents."The review will also match laboratory records of coronavirus cases to existing health records to compile accurate data such as ethnicity and describe the association with Covid-19 cases, alongside other factors such as sex, age and geographical location, PHE said.The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said it was "extremely concerned" about the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME health and care workers.We cannot wait for the data to catch up while people are dyingDame Donna KinnairChief Executive The Royal College Of NursingIts chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair said: "Every day that passes without knowing why this happening is another day with frontline staff being needlessly put at extra risk."All healthcare workers need to be safe right now, and that means that all employees must risk assess BAME employees, including ensuring provision of the right PPE for everyone who needs it."We will continue to call for accurate reporting of the numbers of deaths and infections among BAME healthcare staff across the UK so that swift action can be taken by employers to reduce risk and harm. But we cannot wait for the data to catch up while people are dying."Trevor Phillips, ex-chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: “They say viruses don’t discriminate.“But the faces of those who have died saving lives tell a very different story.“We won’t know the truth about coronavirus until we treat this question with the same seriousness we treat the search for a vaccine.”Heroic medics who have died on the front line are also disproportionately from an ethnic minority.Britain's coronavirus death toll, rose to 28,734 yesterday - second only to Italy's among European nations. 
Stargazers are in for another treat this week as the Eta Aquariids meteor shower reaches its peak.Created by the debris left behind by Halley's comet, the celestial display will come to a climax between midnight and dawn on May 5 and 6.Although it looks more spectacular in the southern hemisphere, it can still be seen in the north.It produces about 30 meteors per hour at its peak - although the light of the nearly full moon this week could obscure all but the brightest meteors.While they're commonly known as shooting stars, meteors are nothing of the sort. They are actually caused by cosmic debris trailing in the wake of comets and asteroids.When the Earth passes through these fragments and particles, pieces fall into the atmosphere and burn up - which is why we can see them as a streak of light in the sky.The Eta Aquariid meteor shower is named after the star Eta Aquarii in the constellation of Aquarius, where the meteors appear to radiate from in the night sky.In the northern hemisphere, this will appear low in the sky in the early pre-dawn hours of May 6.But it should still be possible to see the shower in the eastern sky, according to the Royal Observatory in Greenwich.It's not the only celestial event worth watching this week.Thursday May 7 also marks the fourth and final super moon of 2020.The Super Flower Moon was so-called by early Native Americans because it ushered in the blooming of spring flowers.It is also known as the Corn Planting Moon or the Milk Moon.During a supermoon, the moon can appear up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a normal full moon.The phenomenon happens when the moon is full at the same time as, or very near, perigee - its closest point to Earth on an elliptical, monthly orbit. 
GetYourGuide has made a name for itself as the startup that helped the stale idea of guided tours for travellers on its head. Tapping into the generation of consumers who think of travel not just as going somewhere, but having an “experience” (and, ideally, recording it for Insta-posterity), it has built a marketplace to connect them with people who will help guarantee that this is what they will get. It’s a concept that has helped it sell more than 25 million tickets, hit a $1 billion valuation, and raise hundreds of millions of dollars in VC funding.And the startup has grown quite a lot since passing the 25 million mark in May. “We’ve had 40 million travelers over the last 12 months. We’re the market leader in every European geography. We’re #2 in the U.S. and about to become #1,” co-founder and CEO Johannes Reck said at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin.Now GetYourGuide  is taking the next step in its strategy to expand its touchpoints with users, and grow and diversify its business in the process. The company is expanding its “Originals” business — its own in-house tour operation — into one-day tours and other longer journeys, with the aim of hitting 1 million sales of Originals this year. It will kick off the effort with a small number — between five and 10 — one-day tours in different exotic locations. Examples will include “dune-bashing in Dubai,” glacier excursions from Reykjavik, and trips to Bali’s “most instagrammable hidden spots.”GetYourGuide  Originals have been working well. “We’ve had tremendous success, we have an average score of 4.8 [out of 5] compared to 4.4 for the other marketplace activities,” Reck said. Originals have a 40% higher repeat rate than other activities.“And we’re now extending it to day trips. For those who are not familiar with the travel experience, day trip is the single biggest vertical inside of experiences,” Reck said.Originals was launched a year and a half ago as a way for GetYourGuide to build its own tours — which it kicked off first with shorter walking tours — as a complement to the marketplace where it offers travellers a way of discovering and purchasing places on tours organised by third parties. Today it offers 23 different Originals in 17 cities like Paris, London, Berlin and Rome.Up to now, GYG has sold some 200,000 places on its Originals tours — which is actually a tiny proportion of business, when you consider that the number of tours booked through the platform has passed 25 million.The startup likes to describe its own Orignals as “like Netflix  Originals, but in the real world!” And that analogy is true in a couple of ways. Not only does it give GYG more curatorial control on what is actually part of the tour, where it’s run, who guides it and more; but it gives the company potentially a bigger margin when it comes to making money off the effort, and means it does not have to negotiate with third parties on revenue share and other business details.That’s, of course, not considering the challenges of scaling in this way.Adding in more Originals and extending to transportation to get to the destination (and potentially staying overnight at some point) will mean taking on costs and organizational efforts, and risks, around more operational segments: making sure vehicles are safe and working, that hotels have clean sheets (and rooms), and more. More things can go wrong, and customers will have many more reasons to complain (or praise). It will be one of those moments when the startup will have to rethink what it’s core competency is, and whether it can deliver on that.On the other side, if it works, GYG will diversify its the business while finding new revenue streams. But the strategy to grow Originals is a logical next step for other reasons, too.The most important of these is probably competition: GYG may have been the pioneer of hipster travel experiences, but today it is by no means the only company focusing on this segment. Companies like Airbnb  and TripAdvisor  have tacked on tours and “Experiences” as a complement to their own offerings, as ways of extending their own consumer touchpoints beyond, respectively, booking a place to say or finding a cool place that popular with locals, or figure out what attractions to see.Get Your Guide needs to find ways of keeping existing and new users returning to its own platform, rather than simply tacking on its tour packages while organising other aspects of their vacation.The other is that, as Get Your Guide continues to break ground on changing the conversation around travel, building its own content rather than relying on others to fulfil its vision will become ever more essential, and paves the way for how the company will approach adding ever more components into the chain between your home and your destination.
(CNN)Authorities in Tennessee are reviewing all pending cases involving a Knox County Sheriff's Office detective after he gave a sermon at his church that called for the government to execute members of the LGBTQ community."They are worthy of death," Grayson Fritts said in a June 2 sermon at All Scripture Baptist Church, a small church in Knoxville that he leads.The church posted the sermon online and then removed it, according to The Washington Post. The video was picked up by the Tennessee Holler, an independent liberal news outlet, and edited into a six-minute clip."God has instilled the power of civil government to send the police in 2019 out to the LGBT freaks and arrest them and have a trial for them, and if they are convicted, then they are to be put to death," he said in the clip.Fritts said it would be easy to find people to arrest at events such as gay pride parades."We have a bunch of them we're going to get convicted because they have all their pride junk on, and they're professing what they are, that they're a filthy animal," he said.CNN has not been able to reach Fritts for comment. Speaking to journalists before giving a sermon last Wednesday, Fritts said his anti-LGBTQ beliefs have not interfered with his work as a law enforcement officer."It's totally separate, because if I'm employed by the sheriff's office, then if they came into the sheriff's office, obviously they're allowed there," he said, according to WATE. "You understand what I'm saying? This. I am over this. I am the head of this church. I say who comes and goes. Those people are not permitted to join, those people are not permitted to attend."DA investigating Fritts' casesCharme Allen, the Knox County district attorney general, issued a statement calling Fritts' comments "personally offensive and reprehensible. Allen said she would review all of Fritts' pending cases and an assistant district attorney will review any complaints about closed cases involving Fritts."When any potential witness in a criminal proceeding expresses an opinion of hatred and/or bias towards a class of citizens, I am ethically bound to explore that witness' credibility," Allen said. "Accordingly, I am reviewing all pending cases involving Mr. Fritts to scrutinize them for any potential bias. Although my office has never received a complaint regarding Mr. Fritts prior to this incident, I have assigned an assistant district attorney to receive complaints regarding closed cases, and I will act on those complaints as justice dictates."It's not clear what kinds of cases Fritts investigated. When contacted by CNN, the Sheriff's Office would not comment. CNN affiliate WATE reported that Knox County Sheriff Tom Spangler said Fritts had taken a buyout recently and is on paid sick leave until the workforce reduction takes effect on July 19."I want to be very clear that it is my responsibility to ensure equal protection to ALL citizens of Knox County, Tennessee under the law, my oath and the United States Constitution without discrimination or hesitation. Rest assured that I have and will continue to do so," Spangler said in a statement.Spangler told the Knoxville News Sentinel on Friday that Fritts will not be fired over possible lawsuits based on First Amendment grounds."We looked at every avenue we could look at without violating anybody's First Amendment rights (and) freedom of speech and the best thing for us was what we did," he said. "And that's what we're sticking with."A small churchThe church Fritts leads operates out of a storefront in Knoxville. WATE attended a service on June 12 and reported 16 people attended.The All Scripture Baptist Church website says it is "an independent, fundamental, King James Bible only, soul-winning church. Don't expect anything liberal, watered down, or contemporary here."The website is clear about the church's stance on the gay community:"We believe that sodomy (homosexuality) is a sin that is against nature. A person will only burn in their lust toward the same gender if they have been given over to a reprobate or rejected mind. God said homosexuality should be punished with the death penalty, as set forth in Leviticus 20:13. No homosexual will be allowed to attend or join All Scripture Baptist Church."In the sermon that night, Fritts said he's not an outlier about LGBTQ rights."The world looks at it like, there's Pastor Fritts, there's that lone wolf," he said. "There's Pastor Fritts, that one guy. That one Baptist pastor that's just a lunatic. That's just crazy. Guess what? There's a lot of people that believe exactly like I believe."Mayors criticize FrittsTwo Knoxville public officials criticized Fritts' comments."I am outraged at the statements by Knox County Sheriff's Detective Grayson Fritts," Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero said in a statement posted on the city's website. "Fritts' statements raise concerns locally and nationally about protecting LGBTQ+ rights and equality. Fritts' statements have cast a negative light on our community making it imperative to share my personal position and the position of the City of Knoxville."Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs also criticized Fritts, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel."Mr. Fritts is not my employee so I can only give my personal thoughts on the issue," Jacobs said. "I find his comments to be extremely vile and reprehensible and I strongly condemn threats of or calls for violence."
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Friday said that he was not sorry for his habit of stroking and kissing women in professional settings.“I’m sorry I didn’t understand more. I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything I’ve ever done,” he told reporters in Washington.Mr. Biden is poised to enter the 2020 Democratic presidential race as the front-runner, but recent complaints by several women about his handsy behavior over the years has cast doubt over his expected run.With nearly 50 years in public life, Mr. Biden said that his record speaks for itself.“I’ve never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman,” he said. “You know, it’s not the reputation I’ve had since I was in high school, for God’s sake.”The comments followed Mr. Biden’s first public appearance since the women began coming forward with stories about his touching, hugging and kissing that, while not characterized as sexual assault, made them uncomfortable.Mr. Biden gave a speech to an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers convention, and he joked about the controversy after giving a hug to IBEW President Lonnie Stephenson.“I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie,” Mr. Biden said with a grin, sparking laughter and applause from the crowd.Two days earlier, he posted an online video in which he promised to stop invading people’s personal space. He said he would change with the times.“Social norms have begun to change, they’ve shifted, and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it, I get it,” he said.The promise did not satisfy critics who demand an apology. His comments Friday will not help him on that front.Though polls show him leading a crowded Democratic primary field, Mr. Biden, 76, faces headwinds for being part of the old guard and out of step with the party’s progressive and socialist movement.Mr. Biden said he has always been progressive and did not buy into the news media narrative about the leftward drift of the Democratic Party.“The idea that all the sudden the Democratic Party woke up and, you know, everybody asked what kind of Democrat [are you]? I’m an Obama-Biden Democrat, man. I’m proud of it,” he said.He is expected to enter the race this month.Asked why he was waiting to announce his presidential run, Mr. Biden said that, if he was running, it was always his plan to be “the last person to announce.”
States across the country are moving swiftly to reopen their economies despite failing to achieve benchmarks laid out by the White House for when social distancing restrictions could be eased to ensure the public’s safety during the coronavirus pandemic.These governors’ biggest cheerleader is President Trump.A slew of states — such as Texas, Indiana, Colorado and Florida — have pushed forward with relaxing social distancing guidelines even as the number of people testing positive in many states has increased in recent weeks and testing continues to lag behind. White House recommendations released last month encouraged states to wait to see a decline in cases over a two-week period, as well as having robust testing in place for front-line workers before entering “Phase One” of a gradual comeback.But Trump and some of his aides have backed away from their own guidelines, opting instead to hail the broad economic reopening that health experts say has started too quickly. The dichotomy comes as the White House also tried to distance itself from a draft federal government report predicting an explosion of new coronavirus cases and 3,000 daily deaths by June 1.It underscores how an eagerness by Trump and several state governors to begin restarting normal activities after a weeks-long economic slowdown has clashed with a stubbornly high national caseload that has defied the president’s predictions of a swift and safe reopening. It also marks another round of confusing guidance from Trump, who released the guidelines with fanfare during a briefing and now shows no problem with states that ignore them.“There’s not too many states that I know of that are going up. Almost everybody is headed in the right direction,” Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Sunday, in which he presented a misleading and rosy assessment of the crisis. “We’re on the right side of it, but we want to keep it that way, but we also want to get back to work.”In reality, new coronavirus cases are increasing in about a third of states, compared with just a few where there has been a sustained decline. A plurality of states are hovering around the same level, with neither a significant uptick nor decrease in daily cases. That mirrors the national trend, as the rate of new cases has leveled off in recent weeks but not declined.Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said most governors who have decided to open up are clearly not following the letter of the White House guidelines.“The first part of the criteria is sustained decline. And we don’t see that,” Jha said.To date, 1.2 million people have been infected by the coronavirus and more than 68,000 have died in the United States. Both figures are widely believed to undercount the actual totals.The White House continues to support its guidelines but wants local officials to take the lead in deciding how quickly to ease restrictions, according to a senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. While individual states’ decisions to move more quickly than recommended under the White House guidelines are regularly discussed during coronavirus task force meetings, those decisions are not seen as defiant toward the Trump administration, the official said.One reason could be that Trump rarely discusses his own guidelines, instead encouraging states to move quickly to reverse the economic calamity that took hold as governors imposed stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the virus. Trump has expressed support for protesters pushing their states to end the orders and tweeted about a need to “LIBERATE” several states — including places that White House guidelines indicate should remain in a state of lockdown.Politically, governors have come to learn they are more likely to be criticized by Trump for maintaining stay-at-home orders that comply with White House guidelines than they are for opening up their economies before meeting the Trump administration’s own criteria for doing so.Trump has singled out Virginia for its reluctance to quickly ease social distancing measures, telling Fox News that it was one of the states that “aren’t going fast enough.”Even though the number of coronavirus cases in Virginia continues to rise, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) announced Monday that he would probably begin easing the state’s restrictions on May 15 — including by allowing some gatherings of more than 10 people if social distancing protocols are met.“As you can see, our cases continue to rise,” he said, before adding that the state’s percentage of positive tests — another key measure in the White House guidelines — had begun to decline.Trump’s light criticism of Georgia’s decision to begin opening up businesses including barbershops and bowling alleys before meeting White House benchmarks was short-lived.While the president said on April 23, he was “not happy” with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) for the defying the guidelines, it took him only a week to deny his own remarks.“I didn’t say that,” Trump said Friday when his quote about Kemp was read back to him. “I said I didn’t like the particular place — a spa, a tattoo parlor. No, no, I think it’s wonderful.”As Trump leads the nation’s push for a quick economic reopening, some administration officials have continued to call on states to follow the White House’s detailed guidelines.Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, has repeatedly warned governors against moving too quickly to lift restrictions, saying he was concerned that states that flout the White House guidelines could spark a resurgence of the virus.“The guidelines are very, very explicit, and very clear,” he said last week on NBC’s “Today” show. “There’s a lot of leeway because we give the governors the opportunity to be very flexible, but you have to have the core principles of the guidelines. You can’t just leap over things and get into a situation where you’re really tempting a rebound.”Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, has also called on states and localities to follow the administration’s guidelines but has stopped short of contradicting Trump’s push for governors to move as quickly as possible to return to normal.“We made it very clear that the guidelines are based on very strong evidence and data,” she said Sunday on Fox News. “We’ve made it clear what the gating criteria is.”Several governors have ignored that criteria.In Texas, for instance, new cases dipped in mid-April but have lately been on the rise, with a spike late last week to more than 1,000 daily that has brought the total to more than 32,000. Nonetheless, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) went ahead with a plan to reopen the state’s stores, restaurants, movie theaters and malls provided they operate at less than 25 percent capacity.Lauren Ancel Meyers, a University of Texas at Austin biologist who has modeled possible trend lines in the state’s capital as social distancing requirements are eased, said much will depend on how vigilant people remain with social distancing.Models of potential transmission in Austin that she has run range anywhere from “hardly any additional hospitalizations” to “a catastrophic second wave.”Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) let his stay-at-home order expire last week and replaced it with a far less restrictive set of rules that allow restaurants, shops and fitness centers to open in nearly all parts of the state. Hair and nail salons, which weren’t part of the original reopening, will be allowed to begin service again this week. That’s despite the fact that new cases have jumped in recent days and now total more than 13,000.Some public officials have been unnerved at the speed with which the reopening has happened and the apparent disregard for guidelines set by medical experts.“The state policymakers believe that the economic climate is more important than those guidelines,” said Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke (D). “I don’t see any other explanation.”But as states have defied that criteria to begin restarting business activity — from retail stores in Colorado to restaurants in Florida to elective surgeries in Ohio — they have been cheered on by Trump and his allies.Vice President Pence has hailed the 41 states that have announced or began plans for reopening.But some of those states have pushed ahead with reopening plans that skip ahead of the White House’s recommended phased approach. The recommendations call for certain testing and contact tracing capabilities to be in place before states push forward with returning to normalcy.A lack of planning on those fronts could leave states vulnerable if there is another outbreak, said Jeffrey Shaman, one of the country’s leading epidemiologists at Columbia University.“We don’t have the testing. We don’t have the contact tracing. We can’t detect a rebound,” he said. “It’s a really problematic place to be. This is not where we want to be.”Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska, said the governors are clearly reacting to “shelter-in-place fatigue” as they skirt the guidelines. But he said that’s a risky bet, given the danger that the virus comes roaring back.There is widespread uncertainty about what will happen as states race to ease their restrictions on residents and businesses. A draft government report projects coronavirus cases will surge to about 200,000 per day by June 1, a staggering jump that would be accompanied by more than 3,000 deaths each day.The document predicts a sharp increase in both cases and deaths beginning about May 14, according to a copy shared with The Washington Post. The forecast stops at June 1 but shows both daily cases and deaths on an upward trajectory at that point.The White House and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention disavowed the report, although the slides carry the CDC’s logo. The creator of the model said the numbers are unfinished projections shown to the CDC as a work in progress.The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in a statement called the report a “preliminary” analysis that should not be used as a forecast.Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Bloomberg School who created the model, said 100,000 cases per day by the end of the month is within the realm of possibility, an indication that coronavirus cases could spiral out of control at the same time the White House has shifted focus toward reopening the economy. Much depends on political decisions being made today.“There are reopening scenarios where it could get out of control very quickly,” Lessler said.The White House downplayed the figures on Monday, saying they had not yet been vetted.“This data is not reflective of any of the modeling done by the task force, or data that the task force has analyzed,” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.White House officials have been relying on other models to make decisions on reopening, including one from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and a “cubic model” prepared by Trump adviser and economist Kevin Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers.People with knowledge of the “cubic model” say it shows deaths dropping precipitously in May — and plummeting to zero by May 15, where they stay throughout the summer.Two people with knowledge of the White House task force discussions said that they had not seen the draft government report but that they were both fearful cases could rise with many of the states reopening.The IHME model is now estimating America will reach nearly 135,000 deaths by Aug. 1. That number is significantly higher than its estimate on April 17 of 60,308 deaths.IHME’s new higher projections “reflect the effect of premature relaxation of restrictions,” said its creator, Christopher Murray. “In this era where those mandates are being relaxed, people should be aware the risk of infection is still there.” 
Earlier this year, Google revealed that all Nest accounts will require extra sign-in security starting this spring. For those who haven’t enabled phone—based two factor authentication or have migrated to a Google account yet, that means having to verify their identities via email-based authentication every time they log in. Now, the tech giant has announced that it will begin enforcing that extra security measure for its Nest products starting this month.Users will soon receive an email from accounts@nest.com with a six digit code whenever they log in to verify that they truly own the account they’re trying to access. The only way users can avoid email verification — in case it’s too much of a hassle to check for an email every log in — is to activate two-factor using their phone numbers or to migrate to a Google account. The company says it will notify users before making the security change. For now, it’s advising Nest owners to ensure they still have access to the email they use for Nest.
Wall Street’s biggest money managers are the most upbeat on stocks than they’ve been in months, a sign investors should herald as an omen of a market top in the months ahead, according to investment bank RBC Capital.“Positioning in the US equity market among institutional investors has turned euphoric and highlights the extent to which FOMO (fear of missing out) has gripped the institutional equity investor community,” RBC Head of U.S. Equity Strategy Lori Calvasina wrote to clients.“This keeps us on guard for a period of significant consolidation near-term, and will be an overhang on 2020 performance if not resolved before year end,” the stock strategist added. “When we look at stock market valuations from the perspective of a stock picker, we also see signs of froth in the US equity market.”Calvasina said her caution stems from data showing that asset managers have pushed exposure in U.S. equities through the futures market just above their positioning in July 2019, September 2018, January 2018 and 2007 highs. All of those dates marked “major” peaks in the American stock market.Specifically, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data on U.S. equity futures positioning in November returned to highs in line with pre-Financial Crisis highs, according to RBC analysis. The indicator moved up again the fourth quarter after a summertime plunge, when it fell about halfway back down to the May and December 2018 lows.Though both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were both on track to post gains of more than 20% in 2019, the recent all-time highs in U.S. equity markets follow a turbulent summer.Markets began a months-long slump in late July as soured trade relations between the U.S. and China forced traders to recalibrate their expectations for a resolution between the globe’s two largest economies. The S&P 500 sank nearly 6% between July 26 and August 5, with large-cap equities trading in a range between 2,825 and 2,940 for the following month.RBC isn’t the only investment bank with concerns about funneling more money into equities at current prices. The market’s recent highs have also left some worried that equities may be overpriced in general, with the plurality of strategists surveyed by CNBC advocating a stricter stock-picking strategy in the near term.Investment advisors looking ahead to 2020 have stressed a portfolio that prioritizes low debt and consistent income. Nearly all strategists with 2020 outlooks highlighted the importance of finding under-loved stocks with solid fundamentals opposed to the high-premium, high-growth equities that fueled the S&P 500 for much of the past five years.But marginal improvements in trade rhetoric — notably a “Phase One” trade truce with Beijing — and three interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve through October rekindled investors’ appetite for stocks, which have rallied 10% since last month’s low.But Calvasina isn’t convinced quite yet and argued that the market “has gotten a little too excited about the economy and the Fed.”“The sharp year-over-year gain in the stock market for 4Q19 is something that would normally be seen when the US economy is rapidly accelerating — something that has not been manifest in recent economic data, and something that is not anticipated by sell-side economists (including RBC’s) in coming quarters,” the strategist wrote.A report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed that GDP rose at a 2.1% annual pace in the third quarter, a rate which many economists feel could represent a sort-of growth ceiling for the U.S. over the next decade. But lingering hope among investors that the U.S. economy will be able to surprise to the upside may be what’s keeping the current rally alive, RBC warned.“Realization by equity investors that the US is likely to see moderate as opposed to rapid economic growth in the year ahead could be a catalyst for profit taking,” she added.Despite the call for a short-term pullback, Calvasina thinks the market will recover in 2020. She issued a 2020 S&P 500 target of 3,350, which is slightly higher than the median projection of the strategists tracked by CNBC and implies 6.6% upside from Tuesday’s close.
Worshipers at one of Seoul’s largest Catholic churches must refrain from singing hymns or saying “amen” for fear of spreading saliva. Priests sanitize their hands during communion. Holy water has been removed from the chapel.“This should become the new normal from now on,” said Gong Mi-young, 53, who owns a tutoring school and attended Mass one night this week at Myeongdong Church in the South Korean capital. “We have to be ready for war.”South Korea even has a name for the new practices: “everyday life quarantine.” The authorities recently released a 68-page guide, offering advice on situations like going to the movies (“refrain from shouting”) and attending funerals (“bow your head instead of hugging”).As cities in Asia, Australia and elsewhere get their coronavirus outbreaks under control, churches, schools, restaurants, movie theaters and even sporting venues are starting to open, creating a sense of normalcy for people who have spent weeks and even months in isolation.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storyBut they are returning to a world reimagined for the age of coronavirus, where social distancing, hygiene standards and government-imposed restrictions are infused into nearly every activity — a way of life that is likely to persist until a vaccine or a treatment is found.In Hong Kong, tables at restaurants must be spaced at least five feet apart and customers are given bags to store their face masks during dining.In China, students face temperature checks before they can enter schools, while cafeteria tables are outfitted with plastic dividers.In South Korea, baseball games are devoid of fans and players can’t spit on the field.Many people say they have no choice but to embrace the changes, even as they come to terms with the loss of freedom and spontaneity. At the Salsa Amigos dance club in Seoul, teachers are instructing students to wear masks, take frequent breaks so they don’t sweat and keep a distance of roughly three feet from their partners. Some instructors are avoiding dance routines for couples over worries that students will have too much contact. “I really wish the virus would just go away so I can dance again,” said Woo Tae-hyuck, 48, an employee at a telecom company who attended salsa and bachata lessons this week.The new social customs and mandates in Beijing, Hong Kong and Seoul, as well as Sydney, Australia, and Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, offer a preview of what might soon be common globally. While parts of Europe and the United States are taking tentative steps to loosen restrictions, many cities in Asia and Australia are further along.The coronavirus, or the fear of its spread, arrived earlier in such places, and they have already waged monthslong efforts to mitigate transmission. With new cases at or approaching zero, they now have the confidence to begin opening up — albeit cautiously.Popular tourist sites in China, where the outbreak began in December, are once again accepting visitors, though with strict limits on crowd sizes. The Forbidden City in Beijing is allowing only 5,000 people to visit per day, compared with 80,000 before the outbreak.Libraries in Hong Kong are reopening, but visitors are allowed to be inside for only an hour at a time.Hair salons in Sydney, some of which had closed because of the virus or financial pressures, are back in business with abundant supplies of masks and hand sanitizer. At some, magazines are no longer handed out to customers.Governments are trying to keep the virus at bay while allowing enough room for economic and social activity to pick up again. Officials are testing new sanitation and social-distancing guidelines, like requiring masks on trains and buses and advising the public to avoid face-to-face interactions at work. There are mandatory temperature checks outside restaurants and malls.Some governments are imposing limits on how many people can gather. In Sydney, residents can only host two visitors at a time in their homes, while officials in Hong Kong have prohibited more than four people from being together in a public place. Outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people are discouraged in Taiwan.Churches were a particular focus in South Korea, where the outbreak was tied to a secretive religious sect. Many now require worshipers to book spots at services in advance to limit the number of people, and those who attend must wear masks.Schools represent one of the biggest challenges for governments. Classrooms are notorious as hotbeds of germs and social interactions. But societies won’t be able to truly function until parents can send their children to school full-time.In Sydney, schools are reopening in phases, holding classes one day a week for a quarter of the students from each grade and gradually expanding until the end of June. In Beijing, seniors preparing for college entrance exams are returning, while in Shanghai students in their last year of high school and middle school are doing so as well. Seoul is making plans to head back soon.But educators are not taking chances.In the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, a private elementary school asked students to make hats with three-foot long cardboard wings when classes resumed in late April to learn about social distancing. As they showed off their hats, they answered questions from teachers about the incubation period of the coronavirus and its symptoms.In Taiwan, where classes have been in session since late February, schools have canceled assemblies and ordered students to wear masks and wash their hands regularly. They have asked students to refrain from speaking while they eat and discouraged popular games like Jenga that bring students elbow to elbow. Graduation ceremonies at many schools are moving online.“There are many things I miss, but it’s necessary to fight this disease,” said Lee Yu Cheng, 18, a student at Taipei Municipal Yucheng High School. “If I get infected, what about my family?”Businesses are also taking extra precautions to draw wary customers who have grown accustomed to staying at home.Black Sheep, an upscale restaurant group in Hong Kong, has made temperature checks and surveys about medical history mandatory at its 23 restaurants. Alcohol spray and disposable bags for storing masks are at every table. Black Sheep’s leaders say the measures have helped its image and its business.“A lot of things are not going to return to what they were pre-Covid anytime soon,” said Syed Asim Hussain, a co-founder of Black Sheep. “Old standards are not good enough. Physical distancing is one thing that is definitely here to stay.”Technology is also helping governments and businesses adjust and adapt to the ongoing threat of the virus.At some movie theaters in Seoul, robots have been deployed to offer customers details on schedules and the location of restrooms. Snacks are distributed through an automated kiosk rather than by staff.In China, officials are using apps to track the health and travel history of residents, requiring them to show QR codes to gain entry to restaurants, office buildings and apartment complexes. Zeng Leyi, a designer in Shenzhen, a southern Chinese city, said the measures, including temperature checks at restaurants, gave her peace of mind.“I’m so afraid of death that if they don’t take my temperature, I won’t dare go inside,” said Ms. Zeng, 25.There are few signs that life will truly return to normal anytime soon, even in countries where new coronavirus infections have fallen significantly.Concert halls are silent. Subway cars are sparsely populated. Sports teams in South Korea and Taiwan play in empty stadiums.To combat the sense of isolation, baseball teams in Taiwan are filling the bleachers with cardboard cutouts and mannequins. Some are using robots to belt out music from the stands.In Sydney, beaches have started to reopen, but police officers and lifeguards patrol regularly to ensure that swimmers use the waters only for exercise and do not linger. Paddling, sunbathing and water games are prohibited.The rules have not dampened the spirit of many residents, who say they are relieved to get out of the house again after weeks of lockdown.Desmond Cohn, 26, ducked into the waters at Bondi Beach in Sydney this week. The beaches provide an “emotional outlet” for many residents, he said, and many are eager to reconnect with nature.“Everyone was sort of smiling at each other, looking around,” he said. “We’re all thinking, how bloody good is this? About time.”
Just when you thought 2020 could not get any worse. Now we have giant hornets with freakish eyes and a venomous sting to add to this year's long list of worries.For the first time, Asian giant hornets have been spotted in the United States, specifically in Washington state, scientists say. Beekeepers have reported piles of dead bees with their heads ripped off, an alarming sight in a country with a rapidly declining bee population.At more than two inches long, they're the world's largest hornets with a sting that can kill humans if stung multiple times, according to experts at the Washington State University. The giant insects are nicknamed "murder hornets.""They're like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face," Susan Cobey, a bee breeder at the Washington State University's department of entomology, said recently.A size comparison of the Asian giant hornet and several other insectsHow did they come to the US?Scientists don't know how these giant hornets native to Asia ended up in Washington state.They can sometimes be transported in international cargo, according to Seth Truscott with WSU's college of agricultural, human and natural resource sciences.The giant hornet was first spotted in the state in December, and scientists believe it started becoming active again last month, when queens emerge from hibernation to build nests and form colonies."Hornets are most destructive in the late summer and early fall, when they are on the hunt for sources of protein to raise next year's queens," Truscott said on the WSU's Insider."They attack honey bee hives, killing adult bees and devouring bee larvae and pupae, while aggressively defending the occupied colony," he added. "Their stings are big and painful, with a potent neurotoxin. Multiple stings can kill humans, even if they are not allergic."What should you do if you spot one?Washington state agricultural officials are asking beekeepers and residents to report any sightings of the giant hornets. But don't get too close. Its sting can penetrate a regular beekeeper's suit, and state scientists had to order special reinforced suits."Don't try to take them out yourself if you see them," said entomologist Chris Looney of the state Department of Agriculture. "If you get into them, run away, then call us! It is really important for us to know of every sighting, if we're going to have any hope of eradication."State officials are asking people in Whatcom, Skagit, Island, San Juan, Jefferson and Clallam counties to be especially vigilant.When are they most destructive?The giant hornets especially target bees between late summer and the fall."The most likely time to catch Asian giant hornets is from July through October -- when colonies are established and workers are out foraging," the Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a statement. "Traps can be hung as early as April if attempting to trap queens, but since there are significantly fewer queens than workers, catching a queen isn't very likely."State officials set up traps and launched an app to quickly report sightings, saying just a few of the hornets can devastate a hive within hours.Bees pollinate plants producing fruit, nuts and vegetables, and are crucial to the nation's food industry. Attack by the hornets risks decimating bees, which are already on endangered lists due to their sharply declining numbers. 
Conservative MPs have accused trade unions of “political sabotage” after they rejected plans for encouraging staff back to work after restrictions are eased.The government has sent business leaders a draft proposal setting out a “new normal” for workplaces. These include an end to hot-desking, closing canteens and workers sitting back-to-back or side-to-side.The guidance, for seven different sectors, sets out measures that employers can take where it is not possible to limit social distancing.Frances O’Grady, leader of the TUC, said that there were “huge gaps” over protective equipment and testing. She called for “robust direction and enforcement” so employers can “do the right thing”. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, supported the unions, saying that there must be a “clear mechanism for enforcement”.
ROME — Wearing a Plexiglas visor, large white mask and blue rubber gloves, Catia Gabrielli looked ready for whatever could come her way on Monday as Italy tentatively loosened some of its strictest lockdown provisions against the coronavirus.“I see a lot more movement,” Ms. Gabrielli, a bookstore owner, said in the historic center of Rome as she worried about the people around her, out taking walks without masks. “It’s a lot of people.”That same wariness mixed with hope was expressed throughout Europe and beyond on Monday as at least a dozen countries — including Germany, Spain, Greece, Belgium, Lithuania, France, Nigeria and Lebanon — began to ease weeks of restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the contagion.But in many places, the much-anticipated relaxation of restrictions looked a lot like a real-time experiment in figuring out how to live with the virus. And while the easing varied country to country, many leaders made clear that things could be shut down again — if citizens grew suddenly too incautious.In most countries, not all stores and industry were allowed to resume business. School openings were selective, carried out in reconfigured classrooms, or put off till the fall. Social-distancing rules were still in force. Masks were often required. Bars, cafes and restaurants largely remained shuttered.Italian authorities warned that any loosening of restrictions could be short lived if citizens didn’t adhere to social-distancing measures. And if infections shot up again and overwhelmed health systems just coming up for air, they would lock society back down.“We will intervene and close the tap,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy has said, warning Italians of the dangers of bringing up the curve of infections that the country had worked so hard to suppress. In Italy, the virus has claimed more than 28,000 lives.The problem with relaxing restrictions is that officials will not have a reliable sign of the consequences for at least two weeks — the incubation period of the virus. So there remains the risk that in the blind gap, the virus stealthily surges, setting off another wave of infections, as bad or worse than the first.Public health experts, while recognizing the need to strike a balance between saving lives and livelihoods, have long warned that opening up shops and releasing citizens from their homes could be more difficult and dangerous than shutting them in.Even so, India allowed businesses, local transportation and activities like weddings to resume in areas with few or no known infections. Lebanon reopened bars and restaurants.Nigeria relaxed lockdowns in its capital, Abuja, and its biggest city, Lagos, with markets, stores, malls and construction companies opening.In Germany, which has reported 163,100 infections and 6,692 deaths, according to the Robert Koch Institute, zoos, museums, hairdressers and barbershops opened on Monday for the first time since mid-March.On Sunday, 122 pre-screened worshipers convened in Cologne Cathedral, wearing masks and sitting apart in pews, to celebrate Mass. Other churches will begin services, under similar restrictions, later this week.Some playgrounds opened over the weekend.“It is a huge relief,” said Katherin Bravo, who guided her nearly 2-year-old daughter down a Berlin slide. “You can’t explain to little children why they can’t play here. We would walk by every day and she would say, ‘slide, slide,’ but we had to keep going.”In Spain, where more than 25,000 people have died, small businesses reopened on Monday.The government hopes to return the country to a “new normalcy” by late June, letting some areas with less contagion and hospital saturation open up earlier than more infected parts.Cristina Cros, who owns a small salon in Barcelona, said she was happy to return to work after seven weeks of lockdown, but was also finding the new rules “pretty chaotic.”For example, all clients must stay at least two meters, or roughly six feet, apart while in the salon. The hairdresser must thoroughly clean the premises after each client, and also mop the floor two or three times a day, Ms. Cros explained.“I have been doing as much cleaning as cutting so far,” Ms. Cros said, wearing a mask and gloves, just like her customer. 
Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger is recovering from a reported heart valve replacement surgery, and his representative says he's expected to make a full recovery."Thank you everyone for all your messages of support, I’m feeling much better now and on the mend - and also a huge thank you to all the hospital staff for doing a superb job," the 75-year-old rocker tweeted Friday."Mick Jagger has successfully undergone treatment. He is doing very well and is expected to make a full recovery," the band's spokesperson, Fran Curtis, said in a statement without elaborating on the nature of the procedure.The 75-year-old rocker underwent a heart valve procedure called TAVR at a New York Hospital, Billboard and Rolling Stone reported Friday.On March 30, the Rolling Stones announced that they would be postponing their upcoming tour for Jagger to receive medical treatment. "Mick Jagger has been advised by doctors that he cannot go on tour at this time as he needs medical treatment," the statement read. "The doctors have advised Mick that he is expected to make a complete recovery so that he can get back on stage as soon as possible."Following the announcement, Jagger apologized on social media, writing in an Instagram post, "I'm devastated for having to postpone the tour but I will be working very hard to be back on stage as soon as I can."Jagger's longtime bandmate Keith Richards tweeted that the postponement was a "big disappointment for everyone," but added that "things need to be taken care of and we will see you soon.""We’ll miss you over the next few weeks, but we’re looking forward to seeing you all again very soon," Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood tweeted, addressing the band's loyal fans. "Here’s to Mick ~ thanks for your supportive messages it means so much to us"More: Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood back Mick Jagger amid health concerns as Rolling Stones delay tourThe American Heart Association website defines TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) as a minimally invasive surgical procedure that repairs the valve without removing the old, damaged valve. Instead, it wedges a replacement valve into the aortic valve's place. The surgery may be called a TAVR or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).The procedure is reserved for those people for whom an open heart procedure poses an intermediate risk. For that reason, most people who have this procedure are in their 70s or 80 and often have other medical conditions that make them a better candidate for this type of surgery.
Video advertising company VidMob is announcing that it has raised $25 million in Series B funding.When I wrote about VidMob’s seed funding back in 2015, it was focused on building a marketplace that connected marketers and professional video editors. That’s still a component of the VidMob  business, said founder and CEO Alex Collmer, but the company has also built a broader platform for video advertising, which it calls the Agile Creative Studio.So Collmer said that with VidMob, not only can marketers find professionals (editors, animators, graphic designers and more) to create their ads, they can also “with a single click, send hundreds and in some cases thousands of custom ads” to VidMob partners like Facebook, Google/YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.The platform analyzes how the different creative elements are affecting the way audiences are responding to an ad and uses this data to make campaigns more effective. The result, Collmer said, is that “the decay curve actually inverts and the ad actually improves over time through this iterative process of creating and learning, creating and learning.”Brands using VidMob include Bayer, Intercontinental Hotel Group, Ikea and Neutrogena, as well as startups like Acorns. In a statement, Joshua Palau, the vice president of media platforms and strategy for Bayer U.S., said the platform has “allowed us to meaningfully improve the ROI on our social video campaigns.”VidMob has now raised more than $45 million in total funding. The round was led by Austin-based BuildGroup,  with participation from Acadia Woods, Herington, Interlock Partners, Macanta Investments, the limited partners at Manifest and “brandtech” firm You & Mr Jones.“VidMob solves a really important pain point for brands — how to deliver the volume of content that brands now need for all the different platforms, at the speed and price they need it at,” said You & Mr Jones founder David Jones in a statement. “In the near future all content will be intelligent and driven by data and VidMob has a product that delivers that now.”BuildGroup co-founder and CEO Lanham Napier offered a statement praising VidMob for “not only offering up meaningful insights, but also providing the tools and talent to quickly and cost-effectively activate on that intelligence.”“But it’s their vision for the future that gets us most excited,” Napier added. “As the world moves towards more complex forms of communication, the idea of an API for creativity is so powerful that you can see it becoming another foundational service layer of the web.”Collmer expanded on this idea in our interview, suggesting that VidMob could eventually do much more than facilitate video ads on social media platforms.“As the web is moving from text and images to more complex media types — today that’s video, tomorrow it’s augmented reality, who knows what it will be after that — I’m fairly certain the needle is always going to point towards greater complexity,” he said. “That creative friction becomes a tax on the entire internet. We’re trying to build what I think of as an API for creativity … Today, that friction point is frequently with our platform partners, with the Facebooks and Snaps, but we see it expanding to other areas where you see imagery as the central point of communication.”
More than four million Italians were allowed back to work on Monday, while cafes also reopened in Europe's coronavirus epicentre.It marked the end of the the continent's first and longest, keeping people from their jobs and loved ones.Fabrizia Maselli was allowed to make the short 15-minute walk from home to visit her mother for the first time since the start of March, for an emotional reunion.She is just one of many families kept separated, even those who live close by due to the severity of the lockdown imposed on the country.Protective masks are the new norm and were required on public transport and inside cafes, restaurants and gelato shops that opened for take-out service, while one metre social distancing is still a necessity.The restrictions are similar to those experienced in the UK since the beginning of lockdown in the country.Italy is getting used to the first stage of its new normal, as they can see light at the end of the tunnel.Italians were allowed to go back to work at construction sites, factories and manufacturing jobs deemed to be at lowest risk for contagion.Traffic ticked up in city centers, commuter and long-distance trains sold out and more people ventured out after restrictions on movement eased for the first time since Italy locked down March 11.“We are being careful, trying not to do too many things, but at least we are finally outside and breathing some fresh air,” said Daniele Bianchi as he strolled through Rome’s Villa Borghese park.Across the Tiber in Villa Sciarra, Valerio Pileri stood by the stroller as his 2 1/2 year-old grandson scampered in the grass.“He was going around and around again on the terrace with his bike, but it’s not the same as the villa,” Pileri said. 
A patient treated in a hospital near Paris on 27 December for suspected pneumonia actually had the coronavirus, his doctor has said.This means the virus may have arrived in Europe almost a month earlier than previously thought.Dr Yves Cohen said a swab taken at the time was recently tested, and came back positive for Covid-19.The patient, who has since recovered, said he had no idea where he caught the virus as he had not travelled abroad.Knowing who was the first case is key to understanding how the virus spread.The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is possible more early cases will come to light, and spokesman Christian Lindmeier urged countries to check records for similar cases in order to gain a clearer picture of the outbreak.The French health ministry told the BBC that the government was obtaining confirmation on the case and that it would consider further investigations if they proved necessary.France is not the only country where subsequent testing points to earlier cases. Two weeks ago, a post-mortem examination carried out in California revealed that the first coronavirus-related death in the US was almost a month earlier than previously thought.What do we know about the new case?Dr Cohen, head of emergency medicine at Avicenne and Jean-Verdier hospitals near Paris, said the patient was a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, north-east of Paris.He told the BBC's Newsday programme that the patient must have been infected between 14 and 22 December, as coronavirus symptoms take between five and 14 days to appear.The patient, Amirouche Hammar was admitted to hospital on 27 December exhibiting a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing - symptoms which would later become known as main indications of coronavirus.This was four days before the WHO's China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause being detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Mr Hammar told French broadcaster BFMTV that he had not left France before falling sick. Dr Cohen said while two of the patient's children had also fallen ill, his wife had not shown any symptoms.But Dr Cohen pointed out that the patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come into contact with people who had recently arrived from China. The patient's wife said that "often customers would come directly from the airport, still carrying their suitcases"."We're wondering whether she was asymptomatic," Dr Cohen said.What does it tell us?Could coronavirus have been circulating in Europe in late 2019, many weeks before it was officially recognised and declared a threat there? That is the suggestion being made after a French doctor has revealed that he treated a patient in Paris with all of the symptoms of coronavirus just after Christmas.How does this change what we know about the pandemic? It might be that the test result is an error and so does not change a thing.But it if is correct, it could mean spread of the disease was going unchecked in Europe while all eyes were on the East in Wuhan.Certainly, any laboratories in Europe with samples from patients sick with similar symptoms around that time might want to run a test for coronavirus to see what it reveals so that we can learn more about this new disease.Why does it matter?Until now, what were thought to have been the France's first three cases of coronavirus were confirmed on 24 January. Of those, two had been to Wuhan - where the outbreak was first detected - and the third was a close family member.Mr Hammar's positive test result suggests the virus was present in France much earlier.The first human-to-human transmission within Europe had until now thought to have been a German man who was infected by a Chinese colleague who visited Germany between 19 and 22 January.Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said that if confirmed, Mr Hammar's case highlighted the speed at which an infection starting in a seemingly remote part of the world could quickly seed infections elsewhere."It means that the lead time we have for assessment and decision-making can be very short," Prof Kao said. How was the new case found?Dr Cohen told the BBC that he had the idea to look back at all patients who had been in intensive care units with suspected pneumonia between 2 December and 16 January.He found 14 patients who had tested negative for pneumonia. He defrosted their samples and tested them for traces of Covid-19.He said that out of the 14 samples, one tested positive for traces of Covid-19. A second test on that same sample also came back positive. He added that the patient's chest scan was also compatible with the symptoms of Covid-19.A full report was due later this week, and would be published by the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, Dr Cohen added. 
Delta Air Lines said Thursday it is taking a minority stake in private aviation start-up Wheels Up, in a move that establishes one of the world’s largest fleets of private aircraft.Once the transaction is approved, which is expected in early 2020, Wheels Up will have a fleet of 190 planes and more than 8,000 customers, Delta said.“This groundbreaking partnership will democratize private aviation — making the convenience of private jet travel accessible to more consumers,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement. He added that the agreement “is the latest step in Delta’s ongoing effort to build partnerships that extend Delta’s brand beyond its core business.”The company declined to disclose financial terms but said it expected no impact to its 2019 financial guidance. Delta will also hold an equity position in Wheels Up, which said in August that it had completed a $128 million round of funding that valued the company at $1.1 billion.“It’s a way for us to extend our brand and our ability into a new space,” Bastian told CNBC’s Phil LeBeau in a “Squawk Box” interview from the airline’s investor day in Atlanta.Industry giants such as VistaJet, Directional Aviation and Wheels Up are vying to become the dominant players in the industry.“To partner with the No. 1 airline in the world ... that’s incredible validation for Wheel’s Up,” the company’s founder and CEO Kenny Dichter told CNBC.
Twitter has started testing a new threaded conversation layout that’s meant to make it more obvious who’s talking to whom. Based on the GIF posted by the Twitter Support account, the new layout makes use of lines and indentations to clearly indicate that a reply is meant for a specific tweet. As TechCrunch notes, it looks particularly useful for longer threads where participants go back-and-forth and where people post responses to several separate tweets. The platform has been experimenting with this layout over the past year on its prototype app twttr, TC says, and app researcher Jane Manchun Wong posted a demo on her account in early April. Wong’s demo shows that clicking on a tweet in the threaded layout expands it and gives you an easy way to post a response to it.Twitter been playing with different types of layouts for quite a while now, including putting labels on conversation threads. Just this February, it rolled out a threaded layout similar to this one for iOS users. Since this is just a public experiment, the new feature is only making its way to some users on iOS and the web and will only become widely available if the company decides it’s good enough to ship to everyone.
WIDER patient care during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is being neglected - and that could end up causing long term problems for the NHS is terms of clinical demand, Welsh doctors fear.More than 830 frontline doctors across Wales were surveyed for the British Medical Association (BMA), out of 15,000 UK-wide,.And approaching two-thirds of those from Wales said care for patients not affected by Covid-19 is either significantly worsening (37 per cent) or slightly worsening (25 per cent).Forty per cent of doctors surveyed in Wales also stated that their biggest concern is longer term care for patients.BMA Cymru, which represents doctors across Wales, fears that in the midst of the biggest health crisis in recent history, the health needs of patients have not disappeared, but their care has effectively been placed on hold whilst the NHS deals with the pandemic.There are serious concerns that some patients may have deteriorated and possibly died as a result.“The message we’re getting from doctors is clear; they are worried about the impact this pandemic will have in the long term for patients," said Gwent GP Dr David Bailey, who chairs the BMA’s Welsh Council."Whilst getting through this pandemic is the highest priority at present, equally high on the list must be ensuring that measures are in place to manage patient demand when we come out the other side.“Already, one-in-four doctors said they have been redeployed to cope with the pandemic, and if they return to their usual work as services resume, this would reduce the workforce available for dealing with the demand from Covid-19 care.“We know that many ill patients are not getting the care they need now - they are risking their conditions getting worse and some may even die as a result."Once this current situation eases, there will be a spike in demand, including from patients with far more acute illnesses, caused by a delay in timely treatment. It is vital that the Welsh NHS engages with its clinicians and plans for this now.“Welsh Government must set out a clear plan of how the system will have capacity both for the ongoing demands of the pandemic, as well as resuming services for those patients whose care has effectively been frozen.” 
WASHINGTON (REUTERS) – US lawmakers moved closer on Thursday (Dec 12) to impeaching Republican President Donald Trump, as members of a House of Representatives committee debated formal charges that are likely to be sent to the full House for a final vote next week.The House Judiciary Committee is expected to approve two articles of impeachment later on Thursday, setting up a vote by the Democratic-controlled House next week that is expected to make Trump the third president in US history to be impeached.If the House impeaches Trump, who is charged with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, he would then go on trial in the Senate. The Republican-led chamber is unlikely to vote to find the president guilty and remove him from office.In the first hours of what could be a long day of partisan wrangling, Republicans on the Judiciary panel repeatedly complained about the procedures followed by Democrats in the impeachment inquiry.Republicans requested another hearing and said their rights had been trampled in the inquiry, but were voted down by the panel’s Democratic majority. Republicans also moved to strike the first charge of abuse of power but the committee rejected it on a party line vote.“Rules have just been thrown out the window in this process,” said Republican US Representative Debbie Lesko. “It continues to amaze me how corrupt, how unfair this process has been from the start.”Democrats accuse Trump of abusing his power by trying to force Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and of obstructing Congress when lawmakers tried to look into the matter. Former vice-president Biden is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to run against Trump next year.Republicans on the committee accused Democrats of overplaying their hand and said there were no crimes alleged in the impeachment articles. They said “abuse of power” was a catch-all for Democratic complaints about Trump.“This notion of abuse of power is the lowest of low-energy impeachment theories,” said Republican Representative Matt Gaetz.Democrats chided Republicans for their loyalty to Trump.“Forget about President Trump. Will any one of my colleagues on the other side say that it is an abuse of power to condition aid on official acts?” said Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal.“Is any one of my colleagues willing to say that it is ever OK for a president of the United States of America to invite foreign interference in our elections?”Trump has denied wrongdoing and condemned the impeachment inquiry as a hoax.“No crime!” Trump wrote on Twitter early on Thursday.Much of the impeachment focus has been on a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump has also instructed current and former members of his administration not to testify or produce documents, leading senior officials like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to defy House subpoenas. Democrats say that behavior by Trump constitutes obstruction of Congress.‘PHONY HEARING’ Trump appeared to be watching some of the proceedings, tweeting rebuttals to Democratic arguments as they were made. he said Democrats were misrepresenting his talks with Ukraine and called the proceedings a “phony hearing.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters the full House would take up the articles of impeachment next week if approved by the committee.A Senate trial is expected next month on the charges. Senior Republicans in the chamber appeared to be moving toward a consensus that a streamlined proceeding with no witnesses would allow Trump and the Senate to end the matter and quickly move on.Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said on Wednesday no decision had yet been made over how to conduct the trial.Democrats sought to simplify the public case against Trump by not including other contentious aspects of Trump’s tenure, such as his efforts to impede former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. Democratic lawmakers from more conservative districts had argued the focus should stay on Ukraine.Still, while the Judiciary Committee is likely to approve the articles, several Democrats in swing districts remain unsure how they will vote on impeachment, although with a 36-seat Democratic lead over Republicans in the House, passage is expected.Trump and Republicans have tried to use the issue as way to attack Democratic presidential candidates and those vulnerable House members.Pelosi said Democratic House leaders were not pressuring any uncertain members to support the impeachment. “I do not ask anybody what their vote is,” she said.Public support for impeachment has largely fallen along party lines, with the vast majority of Democrats supporting it and most Republicans opposing it. Trump’s approval rating, according to opinion polls, has largely remained consistent throughout the inquiry.
he global industry potential of artificial intelligence is well-documented, yet the vision of this AI future is uncertain.AI and automation trends are generating significant debate among economists and governments, particularly around employment impact and uncertain social outcomes. The mainstream attention is warranted. According to PwC,  AI “could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030, more than the current output of China and India combined.”AI is at a crossroads, and its long-term outlook is still hotly debated. Despite social media giants, automotive companies and numerous other industries investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI, many automation technologies are not yet directly generating revenue and instead are forecasted to become profitable in the coming decades. This creates additional uncertainty of AI’s true market potential. The realistic potential value of AI is unknown, yet, as the technology advances, the ultimate impact could be of great consequence to virtually every economy.There are many reasons to view AI’s future from an optimistic lens, however: chatbots provide significant evidence for AI’s positive impact on both business growth and employment markets. Today, chatbots are increasingly capable of mimicking human interactions and conversations to assist business-to-business, business-to-consumer, business-to-government, advertising audiences and other diverse groups. The evolution of the cognitive computer science behind conversational chatbots is perhaps one of the best examples of AI technologies driving revenue. Further, chatbot technology shows some of the greatest promise for augmenting, rather than replacing human workers.AI is driving value while augmenting human workersChatbots  are delivering real revenue today for some of the world’s leading financial services (Bank of America),  retail (Levi’s), and technology companies (Zendesk) . We’re seeing more consumers taking the next step in a transaction or even making a purchase decision based off conversations with chatbots. Beyond driving sales, chatbots have numerous applications to a wide range of organizations. Nonprofits, NGOs, and even political campaigns find value in deploying chatbots to help handle the influx of inquiries from stakeholders and relevant audiences.Rather than these chatbots replacing human workers, organizations are finding chatbots to be a helpful and value-creating opportunity that frees employees to focus on more strategic tasks. Apple’s Siri, Amazon  Alexa and Microsoft Cortana aren’t replacing executive assistants today, but these technologies are all capable of supporting the executive assistant function in the workplace.Gartner predicts AI augmentation, defined as a “human-centered partnership model of people and AI working together to enhance cognitive performance,” could generate $2.9 trillion of business value by 2021. Many industries see potential for chatbots to augment functions like sales, customer support and IT, enabling workers to create value in more strategic ways. Bain & Company finds chatbots to be among the most notable examples of artificial intelligence and automation in practice: “Companies use AI applications to understand industry trends, manage their workforce, address problems, power chatbots and personalize content to enable self-service.”Clearly, the implications of scaled, human-like engagement are stunning in their capacity to carry out tasks. A chatbot’s ability to simultaneously hold tens of thousands of conversations — pulling from many millions of data points — is comparable to what a human customer service rep could accomplish in more than 1,000 years of nonstop work. Scaling customer service via AI allows service professionals to focus on big picture and more complex issues, and it provides rich data on customer interactions. We anticipate seeing more companies look to build better customer service experiences through chatbots, as Google and Salesforce announced in April.
Elon Musk could be serious about selling his possessions, after reports two luxury homes in California have been put up for sale.On Friday, the Tesla boss included in a series of tweets a promise to get rid of his "physical possessions".Now two properties that belong to Mr Musk are on the property website Zillow with a $40m (£32m) price tag.It comes as the maverick billionaire, 48, and Canadian singer Grimes welcomed their first child."Mom & baby all good," he announced on Twitter, a relatively restrained tweet compared with his other postings over the past few days. He said the baby was called X Æ A-12.Among Friday's tweets was a claim Tesla's value was too high - a remark which could be scrutinised by regulators. It prompted a sell-off of shares by investors, wiping $14bn from the electric carmaker's stock market value.Another tweet said his girlfriend was "mad" at him, while others bordered on the mystical. He's also been tweeting his opposition to the US coronavirus lockdown, saying in one: "FREE AMERICA NOW".Mr Musk's promise to sell his possessions included a home formerly owned by Hollywood legend Gene Wilder, and which he bought in 2013.That house, complete with pool and guest cottage, is on the Zillow website for $9.5m. The second, described as "on private knoll overlooking Bel Air Country Club and the city and ocean beyond", has a $30m sale price.The Los Angeles homes are listed as "for sale by owner", rather than with a sales agent. That led some people to wonder if Mr Musk was serious about the sales, or even if the Zillow website could have been hacked. "We don't know - everyone is trying to find out," one estate agent told the Los Angeles Times. Mr Musk is thought to own several houses in California. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that he or companies tied to him had spent $100m on seven properties in the state, many of which are close to his primary home.The birth of his son on Monday adds to the five children he has with his first wife, the Canadian author Justine Wilson.Grimes, 32, has been keeping fans updated throughout her pregnancy and in February revealed she had suffered "complications" and felt she was "woefully ill-prepared" to have a baby. Later that month she told fans on Twitter she would allow the child to choose its own gender.South Africa-born Mr Musk and Grimes (Claire Boucher) have been dating for more than two years and made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2018 Met Gala. 
Australia and New Zealand are planning a "travel bubble", or corridor, that will allow the quarantine-free flow of people between the two neighbours.Both countries have severely restricted international travel to prevent the spread of coronavirus.However, if successful, the "bubble" could grow to include more countries that have a low number of cases.A wider scheme is planned with Canada and other Asian economies to help supply chains and business travel.The governments of Australia and New Zealand revealed their plans on Tuesday to set up a "trans-Tasman travel bubble", although no timeframe was given.This quarantine-free travel zone could provide huge advantages to both nations, who have shown strong records for containing the virus. Currently, they impose a 14-day quarantine on international arrivals.New Zealand PM: No open borders for 'a long time'How NZ beat the virus and got its coffee backAustralia eyes early lifting of virus restrictions"The broader reality is the global travel market is in a very bad way. In our part of the world and around the trans-Tasman route it makes clear sense that a travel bubble can work in our neck of the woods," said Simon Westaway, executive director at the Australian Tourism Industry Council.Qantas, Australia's biggest airline, wants to start using the travel bubble once domestic flights across Australia are resumed."It's a positive we weren't expecting up till now and hopefully it can be established as a model to open part by part the international network when various countries have a control on Covid-19," said the airline's chief executive, Alan Joyce.According to Mr Joyce, New Zealand is the second-largest source of tourists heading into Australia, while Australia is the largest source of tourists for New Zealand.He said it would give people in Australia a destination "that they're comfortable flying to", and vice versa.Mr Joyce hopes the travel bubble can be extended to more countries if successful."If the New Zealand bubble idea gets traction and that we're comfortable with that and that seems like it's working well, then a similar approach could be done with markets where countries have Covid-19 under control."Chris Roberts, chief executive of New Zealand's tourist board Tourism Industry Aotearoa, said it needed the correct health safeguards and the best use of technology to work."If New Zealand and Australia can show this can work, then it is likely to be adopted elsewhere. It could be 12-18 months before we return to open borders." Mr Roberts hopes the travel bubble will include its Pacific Island neighbours as they are heavily dependent on tourism. After that "New Zealand would likely look to places like Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and South Korea which are doing well in the fight against Covid-19 as the next places to re-establish links with".Australia and New Zealand are also involved in a larger "trade bubble" looking to agree guidelines for essential business travel. The wider group includes Canada, South Korea and Singapore.The group's aim is to resume the flow of goods, services and key people. The plan includes "guidelines to allow, on an exceptional basis, essential cross-border travel for purposes such as maintaining global supply chains, including essential business travel," according to a joint statement.The countries also want a fast-tracking customs procedure on essential items such as food and medical supplies, and to restart logistics networks across air, sea and land freight. 
Among the most important unanswered questions about Covid-19 is this: What role do children play in keeping the pandemic going?Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do have mild symptoms, if any. But do they pass the virus on to adults and continue the chain of transmission?The answer is key to deciding whether and when to reopen schools, a step that President Trump urged states to consider before the summer.Two new studies offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. Neither proved it, but the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said.Many other countries, including Israel, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have all either reopened schools or are considering doing so in the next few weeks.In some of those countries, the rate of community transmission is low enough to take the risk. But in others, including the United States, reopening schools may nudge the epidemic’s reproduction number — the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case, commonly referred to as R0 — to dangerous levels, epidemiologists warned after reviewing the results from the new studies.In one study, published last week in the journal Science, a team analyzed data from two cities in China — Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, and Shanghai — and found that children were about a third as susceptible to coronavirus infection as adults were. But when schools were open, they found, children had about three times as many contacts as adults, and three times as many opportunities to become infected, essentially evening out their risk.Based on their data, the researchers estimated that closing schools is not enough on its own to stop an outbreak, but it can reduce the surge by about 40 to 60 percent and slow the epidemic’s course.“My simulation shows that yes, if you reopen the schools, you’ll see a big increase in the reproduction number, which is exactly what you don’t want,” said Marco Ajelli, a mathematical epidemiologist who did the work while at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The second study, by a group of German researchers, was more straightforward. The team tested children and adults and found that children who test positive harbor just as much virus as adults do — sometimes more — and so, presumably, are just as infectious.“Are any of these studies definitive? The answer is ‘No, of course not,’” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who was not involved in either study. But, he said, “to open schools because of some uninvestigated notion that children aren’t really involved in this, that would be a very foolish thing.”The German study was led by Christian Drosten, a virologist who has ascended to something like celebrity status in recent months for his candid and clear commentary on the pandemic. Dr. Drosten leads a large virology lab in Berlin that has tested about 60,000 people for the coronavirus. Consistent with other studies, he and his colleagues found many more infected adults than children.The team also analyzed a group of 47 infected children between ages 1 and 11. Fifteen of them had an underlying condition or were hospitalized, but the remaining were mostly free of symptoms. The children who were asymptomatic had viral loads that were just as high or higher than the symptomatic children or adults.“In this cloud of children, there are these few children that have a virus concentration that is sky-high,” Dr. Drosten said.He noted that there is a significant body of work suggesting that a person’s viral load tracks closely with their infectiousness. “So I’m a bit reluctant to happily recommend to politicians that we can now reopen day cares and schools.”Dr. Drosten said he posted his study on his lab’s website ahead of its peer review because of the ongoing discussion about schools in Germany.Many statisticians contacted him via Twitter suggesting one or another more sophisticated analysis. His team applied the suggestions, Dr. Drosten said, and even invited one of the statisticians to collaborate.“But the message of the paper is really unchanged by any type of more sophisticated statistical analysis,” he said. For the United States to even consider reopening schools, he said, “I think it’s way too early.”In the China study, the researchers created a contact matrix of 636 people in Wuhan and 557 people in Shanghai. They called each of these people and asked them to recall everyone they’d had contact with the day before the call.They defined a contact as either an in-person conversation involving three or more words or physical touch such as a handshake, and asked for the age of each contact as well as the relationship to the survey participant.Comparing the lockdown with a baseline survey from Shanghai in 2018, they found that the number of contacts during the lockdown decreased by about a factor of seven in Wuhan and eight in Shanghai.“There was a huge decrease in the number of contacts,” Dr. Ajelli said. “In both of those places, that explains why the epidemic came under control.”The researchers also had access to a rich data set from Hunan province’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials in the province traced 7,000 contacts of 137 confirmed cases, observed them over 14 days and tested them for coronavirus infection. They had information not just for people who became ill, but for those who became infected and remained asymptomatic, and for anyone who remained virus-free.Data from hospitals or from households tend to focus only on people who are symptomatic or severely ill, Dr. Ajelli noted. “This kind of data is better.”The researchers stratified the data from these contacts by age and found that children between the ages of 0 and 14 years are about a third less susceptible to coronavirus infection than those ages 15 to 64, and adults 65 or older are more susceptible by about 50 percent.They also estimated that closing schools can lower the reproduction number — again, the estimate of the number of infections tied to a single case — by about 0.3; an epidemic starts to grow exponentially once this metric tops 1.In many parts of the United States, the number is already hovering around 0.8, Dr. Ajelli said. “If you’re so close to the threshold, an addition of 0.3 can be devastating.”However, some other experts noted that keeping schools closed indefinitely is not just impractical, but may do lasting harm to children.Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the decision to reopen schools cannot be made based solely on trying to prevent transmission.“I think we have to take a holistic view of the impact of school closures on kids and our families,” Dr. Nuzzo said. “I do worry at some point, the accumulated harms from the measures may exceed the harm to the kids from the virus.”E-learning approaches may temporarily provide children with a routine, “but any parent will tell you it’s not really learning,” she said. Children are known to backslide during the summer months, and adding several more months to that might permanently hurt them, and particularly those who are already struggling.Children also need the social aspects of school, and for some children, home may not even be a safe place, she said.“I’m not saying we need to absolutely rip off the Band-aid and reopen schools tomorrow,” she said, “but we have to consider these other endpoints.”Dr. Nuzzo also pointed to a study in the Netherlands, conducted by the Dutch government, which concluded that “patients under 20 years play a much smaller role in the spread than adults and the elderly.”But other experts said that study was not well designed because it looked at household transmission. Unless the scientists deliberately tested everyone, they would have noticed and tested only more severe infections — which tend to be among adults, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.“Assumptions that children are not involved in the epidemiology, because they do not have severe illness, are exactly the kind of assumption that you really, really need to question in the face of a pandemic,” Dr. Hanage said. “Because if it’s wrong, it has really pretty disastrous consequences.”A new study by the National Institutes of Health may help provide more information to guide decisions in the United States. The project, called Heros, will follow 6,000 people from 2,000 families and collect information on which children get infected with the virus and whether they pass it on to other family members.The experts all agreed on one thing: that governments should hold active discussions on what reopening schools looks like. Students could be scheduled to come to school on different days to reduce the number of people in the building at one time, for example; desks could be placed six feet apart; and schools could avoid having students gather in large groups.Teachers with underlying health conditions or of advanced age should be allowed to opt out and given alternative jobs outside the classroom, if possible, Dr. Nuzzo said, and children with underlying conditions should continue to learn from home.The leaders of the two new studies, Dr. Drosten and Dr. Ajelli, were both more circumspect, saying their role is merely to provide the data that governments can use to make policies.“I’m somehow the bringer of the bad news but I can’t change the news,” Dr. Drosten said. “It’s in the data.” 
It's not just that President Donald Trump has been spouting nonsense at a greater rate, although he is. What's new is that his false statements are becoming more bizarre. He said this week, for example, that his Bronx-native father was born in Germany. And they are accompanied by other displays of apparent cognitive distress. Among the glaring examples:    Last month, the President of the United States looked at Apple executive Tim Cook, one of the most important business leaders in the world, and called him Tim Apple.    A few days earlier at a conservative conference where he literally hugged a flag, Trump ditched his script and rambled for two mostly incoherent hours. He mixed mockery, profanity and grandiosity in a style more suited to a barstool than a podium decorated with the presidential seal.    In an Oval Office encounter with reporters this week, he repeatedly used the word "oranges" instead of "origins" to demand an investigation into the beginnings of the independent counsel's probe of Russian influence in the 2016 election.    Bizarrely, he told a GOP fundraiser audience that "they say" the sound created by energy-producing windmills "causes cancer."    In any family, a 72-year-old man who spoke this way would be the subject of urgent discussions. Trump's trouble accessing words, summoning long-term memories, and naming a famous man in front of him could indicate mental deterioration. Add the crazy talk about windmills and cancer, coming from the leader of the free world, and you get a situation that ought to alarm everyone.This situation is complicated by Trump's long and deep record of lying to suit his purpose. For decades, he made excessive claims about his wealth and abilities and the ratings for his reality TV show. Fantastic claims became his self-serving stock in trade. As a politician, Trump transferred this deceptive method into the political landscape -- call it his lie-scape -- and picked up the pace of the falsehoods.Trump's record makes it hard to pick out trends. Sometimes he seems to exaggerate and distort for effect. At other moments, it seems he believes the crazy stuff he says. But it is possible to evaluate a public figure's speech patterns and make objective observations.In 2017, Stat News, the health news website, asked experts in neurolinguistics and cognitive assessment, psychologists and psychiatrists to review his past and recent speech and found evidence of decline from his younger days.In interviews in the 1980s and '90s, according to Stat News, Trump "spoke articulately, used sophisticated vocabulary, inserted dependent clauses into his sentences without losing his train of thought, and strung together sentences into a polished paragraph, which — and this is no mean feat — would have scanned just fine in print." More recently, noted Stat, "Trump's vocabulary is simpler. He repeats himself over and over, and lurches from one subject to an unrelated one." When shown examples of the two Trumps, experts saw symptoms that "can indicate slipping brain function due to normal aging or neurodegenerative disease."If Trump were a private citizen, his condition wouldn't matter to anyone outside a close circle. He would be evaluated, his father's Alzheimer's disease might be noted as a red flag, and, one hopes, he would get the help he needs. But Trump is the most powerful person in the world and can do great harm with what he says.In a flurry of tweets Tuesday, Trump mangled the facts of Puerto Rico's hurricane recovery effort, suggesting the island has received $91 billion in relief money. (The correct figure is $11.2 billion; $91 billion is how much the federal government may disburse to Puerto Rico over the next two decades). He also planted the canard that somehow mainland farmers are being exploited in the equation. "Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!" wrote TrumpThe Puerto Rico misstatements are so egregious that one hopes they could be blamed on a mind in decline. The alternative holds that Trump was lying and that he is an intentionally divisive and destructive leader of truly bad character who demonizes one set of constituents to stir resentment among another. For Americans who are subject to Trump's rhetoric, the most alarming element may be what it does to us. Leaders and those they lead exist in a dynamic relationship. A president's words and gestures can both inspire and terrify. The talk coming from this President is frightening, destabilizing and bewildering. We don't want to think that the man in the Oval Office is unfit, but when he repeatedly shows us the evidence, how can we draw another conclusion?
The Monday Market MinuteGlobal stocks slump as investors fret over the potential for trade conflict as the U.S. and China bicker over the origins of the coronavirus.President Donald Trump again raises the prospect of China reprisals while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says there is "enormous evidence" the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan.Factory data around the world paints an historically grim picture of April output, with European PMI levels falling to 33.4.The U.S. dollar books solid gains as traders adopt a defensive tone heading into the week, which will see 156 S&P 500 companies reporting alongside factory output, weekly jobless and April employment data. U.S. states move to re-start regional economies, with 22 expected to lift or ease stay-at-home restrictions over the next ten days.Wall Street futures suggest a weaker open ahead of earnings from Wynn Resorts and Skyworks as well as factory output data at 9:45 am Eastern time.U.S. equity futures slumped lower Monday, while oil traded firmly in the red and the dollar trended higher, as investors grew increasingly unsettled by the prospect of a bitter debate between Washington and Beijing over the origin of the coronavirus and factory data painted a grim picture of its economic damage in the world's biggest markets.In a virtual town hall late Sunday, Trump again raised the idea of reprisals against China for its lack of transparency during the early stages of the outbreak, which has now risen to 3.5 million people around the world and caused at least 250,000 deaths. He also suggested the U.S. could "terminate' the January trade deal with China, and said tariffs were "at a minimum are the greatest negotiating tool that we have ever devised."Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in fact, went one step further, telling Sunday media that there was "enormous evidence" that the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, had emerged from a virology lab in the city of Wuhan.The potential for a renewed trade war between the world's two biggest economies could overshadow any market benefit from the re-start of business and factory activity in the United Sates, where at least 22 states are set to either lift of relax "stay-at-home" orders over the next ten days.Factory data from around the world Monday, as well, suggested some of the worst monthly downturns on record, with activity in Europe slumping to an all-time low of 33.4 points over the month of April. With corporate earnings slated to decline 12.7% over the first quarter, and a further 37.8% over the three months ending in June, investors may struggle to take stocks higher in the days ahead as more economic benchmarks reveal the scale of the coronavirus damage and Friday's April employment report tallies the cots to the U.S. jobs market.With that risk in the window, U.S. equity futures were trading firmly lower to start the week, with contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicating a 235 point opening bell decline and those linked to the S&P 500 suggesting a 21 point pullback for the broader benchmark.Airline shares were notable pre-market movers Monday after billionaire investors Warren Buffett told investors over the weekend that he's dumped all his holdings in the sector in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Delta Air Lines DAL, one of the four carriers Buffett exited last month, was marked 10.7% lower in pre-market trading Monday to indicate an opening bell price of $21.88 each. It's main domestic rivals, American Airlines AAL and United Airlines UAL, were marked 11.7% and 10.3% lower respectively, while U.S.-focused Southwest Airline LUV was seen 7.9% lower at $27.10 each.The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six global currencies and has lately been seen as a useful indicator for risk market sentiment, traded 0.3% higher at 99.358 in overnight dealing as investors plowed cash into safe haven assets. That pushed 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields lower, to around 0.613%, in early European trading.European stocks kicked-off their May campaign on a sour note, with traders returning from their May Day holiday Friday to take the Stoxx 600 2.5% lower, lead to the downside by a 3.2% slump for the trade-sensitive DAX performance index, while Britain's FTSE 100, which was open for trading on Friday, fell 0.20%.“Euro area manufacturing output plunged to an extent greatly exceeding any decline previously seen in the near 23-year history of the PMI survey in April, reflecting a combination of factors including widespread factory closures, slumping demand and supply shortages, all linked to the COVID-19 outbreak," said Markit's chief economist Chris Williamson.Global oil prices were on the back foot, as well, following last week's surge, which was largely driven by speculative buying after prices hit near record lows amid concerns over a glut of supply and a lack of storage facilities for unwanted crude.Front-month WTI futures contracts for June delivery, the new benchmark for U.S. prices, were last seen $1.44 lower from their Friday close in New York and changing hands at $18.34 per barrel.Brent futures for July delivery, which benchmark around 60% of global crude purchases, were marked 73 cents lower at $25.71 per barrel.Overnight in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 was shut for Children's Day, one of the country's traditional early May holidays, sapping liquidity around the region and leaving the U.S. dollar to mop-up the risk-averse moves in currency markets. The region-wide MSCI ex-Japan index, meanwhile, was seen 1.6% lower heading into the close of trading, although a weaker yuan again helped lift China's Shanghai Composite to a 1.3% gain even as Hong Kong slumped 4.2% and the South Korean KOSPI fell 2.7%.
WASHINGTON – Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page said President Donald Trump lied about her and former FBI Agent Peter Strzok during his rally Tuesday night in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where he once again mocked and derided the pair for disparaging remarks they made about him in text messages. At the rally, Trump claimed, without evidence, that Page had taken out a restraining order against Strzok."That's what I heard. I don't know," Trump said. "This is a lie," Page said in a tweet responding to a clip of Trump's comments. "Nothing like this ever happened. I wish we had a president who knew how to act like one. SAD!" It was unclear upon what the president was basing his claim. Trump has frequently targeted Page and Strzok since their text messages surfaced during special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and potential collusion with the Trump campaign. Strzok was removed from Mueller's team because of the texts and was later dismissed from the FBI. Page resigned from the bureau in May 2018. 'I decided to take my power back': Ex-FBI lawyer Lisa Page speaks out on Trump's 'sickening' attacksMore: Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page accuses FBI and Justice Department of violating privacy by releasing anti-Trump textsThe president has held them up as proof the Russia investigation was a politically motivated "witch hunt," and did so again Tuesday, despite a report from the Justice Department's inspector general that found the launch of the probe was legally justified. In his attacks, the president has also often mocked them for an extramarital affair that was revealed in their exchanges. On Tuesday, Trump said Page and Strzok were "so in love" that they "couldn't see straight." He then said he had "heard" Page had to get a restraining order against Strzok. "I don't know if it's true. The fake news will never report it. but it could be true," Trump said, drawing jeers from the crowd at the mention of the news media. "No, that's what I heard. I don't know. I mean, who could believe a thing like that? No, I heard that Peter Strzok needed a restraining order to keep him away from his once lover. Ah, Lisa, I hope you miss him. Lisa, he'll never be the same." Page, 39, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Justice Department for violating federal privacy law with the release of her exchanges with Strzok. In a rare interview this month, Page spoke out about Trump's "sickening" attacks on her, which she said were "demeaning me and my career." GOP reacts to Lisa Page interview: 'I actually think that she feels really sorry for herself'"But it's also very intimidating because he’s still the president of the United States. And when the president accuses you of treason by name, despite the fact that I know there's no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason, he's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that," she told The Daily Beast. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz examined her text messages with Strzok as part of his probe into whether anti-Trump bias played a role in the decision to open the Russia investigation. Horowitz found that while the texts "created an appearance of bias" and "raised serious questions" about the validity of decisions involving Page and Strzok, Page was not part of the decision to start the probe. And Horowitz said Strzok "was not the sole, or even the highest level decision maker."

Microsoft has repurposed Windows 10X, the new cut of its OS introduced in October 2019 to run on dual-screen devices.When announcing Windows 10X Microsoft said it "is designed for new dual-screen PCs and not as an OS upgrade if you already own a PC." Microsoft also suggested that users who put the OS in harness with dual-screen devices would experience amazing productivity boosts. And then it said both Windows 10X and dual-screen gadgetry like its own Surface Neo would appear for pre-Christmas-2020 sales.Now Microsoft has backed away from Windows 10X as a built-for-dual-screen Windows, and cast doubt on when dual-screen gadgets will appear.A new post by chief product officer for windows and devices Panos Panay said:“With Windows 10X, we designed for flexibility, and that flexibility has enabled us to pivot our focus toward single-screen Windows 10X devices that leverage the power of the cloud to help our customers work, learn and play in new ways. These single-screen devices will be the first expression of Windows 10X that we deliver to our customers, and we will continue to look for the right moment, in conjunction with our OEM partners, to bring dual-screen devices to market.”What’s changed?A certain virus, from the sound of things.“The world is a very different place than it was last October when we shared our vision for a new category of dual-screen Windows devices,” Panay wrote. “As we continue to put customers’ needs at the forefront, we need to focus on meeting customers where they are now. Our customers are leveraging the power of the cloud more than ever, and we believe the time is right to lean into this acceleration in a different way.”Microsoft will reveal what that means at its virtual Build conference from May 18th. Panay teased that news by saying “We are going to share how we will reduce complexity for developers by making it easier than ever to build for all 1 billion Windows 10 devices, all at once. We will share how we will enable developers to build applications that seamlessly enable cloud-powered virtualization.”The post does not, however, offer any explanation about how the promised productivity revolution delivered by the combo of dual screen devices and Windows 10X will come about with the OS on single-screen devices. Or if the announcements planned for Build will reveal those plans.All is not lost because 10X had architectural interest beyond the dual-screen angle. As Microsoft explained when announcing the OS, 10X would include "newly implemented support for running Win32 applications in a container" plus "further componentization and additional investments ... to deliver more flexible experiences with a wide range of input types and hardware postures all while managing Windows applications and how they use the battery."Which sounds like a worthy upgrade. Perhaps more so than the Windows 10 update emerging later this May. Panay wrote that refresh brings with it “a more streamlined way to pair Bluetooth devices in Windows” and “an improved tablet experience when you detach your 2-in-1’s keyboard, allowing you to keep the familiarity of your desktop while at the same time optimizing for touch.”Windows 10X will presumably be just a little more profound.
An Illinois weatherman is out of a job after his on-air criticism of his station’s “Code Red” weather alerts went viral.Joe Crain, who has been a meteorologist at WICS in Springfield for the past 15 years, rose to fame last week after he slammed his station’s management for mandating the alarmist alerts without recognizing that “not all storms are created equal.”“As far as myself goes, I don’t take myself very seriously, but I do take my job seriously, and my responsibility to the public,” Mr. Crain told viewers. “We want you to know that it’s not us. This is a corporate initiative, the Code Red Alert. Behind the scenes, many of us have tried to dissuade it, for the last few months, to try something else that’s less controversial to the viewers.”Mr. Crain, who hasn’t been on air since the June 5 speech, sparked a wave of support by people who are now “livid” by his absence, a source from the station’s parent, Sinclair Broadcast Group, told CNN.“Joe was let go,” a Sinclair spokesperson confirmed to CNN.The company posted a job listing for a WICS full-time morning meteorologist on Tuesday.WICS, a CNN affiliate, said Monday that it will change its “Code Red” warning alert to “Weather Warn,” similar to other Sinclair-owned stations.“We live and work and have families and friends in this community — safety is deeply personal for us,” WICS said in a statement. “We firmly believe in the need to provide an early warning alert and will continue to provide this potentially lifesaving information, but we have come to understand that the words Code Red may no longer be fitting. As such, we are changing the name of our early warning alert to ‘Weather Warn.’ In addition, we will continue to work to more precisely define the specific geographic areas of greatest concern.”
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour party wants talks with Prime Minister Theresa May to continue, its Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said on Friday after Labour urged May to offer genuine changes to her EU withdrawal deal.“We want the talks to continue and we’ve written in those terms to the government, but we do need change if we’re going to compromise,” Starmer said.Prisons minister Rory Stewart told the BBC there were “tensions” but there was “quite a lot of life” left in the talks.
Recently fired Houston Texans general manager Brian Gaine “targeted” African American employees in a series of firings during his tenure, a former Texans security coordinator alleged in a complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Jeff Pope, who was notified he would not be retained by the team May 8, made a series of allegations in a 4,500-word charge of discrimination complaint obtained by USA TODAY Sports early Thursday morning. Gaine was fired by the Texans on Friday with little insight into the move disclosed by the team. Attempts to reach Gaine were not immediately successful Thursday morning.Texans spokesperson Amy Palcic told The Houston Chronicle that Pope’s allegations of racial bias “was not a factor in the recent decision to relieve Brian Gaine from his job as general manager.” “We have just been made aware of Mr. Pope’s claim,” Palcic said. “We do not comment on pending litigation. The Houston Texans do not tolerate personal or professional discrimination of any kind."Pope, who is African American, listed eight other African Americans who were allegedly fired by Gaine after he took over as GM in January 2018. “It appeared, and I believe, that he was targeting all minorities in leadership positions and was set to replace them with non-African-Americans. Which he did,” Pope wrote in the complaint.Pope wrote that it became evident that African Americans were “being singled out/targeted” when Gaine allegedly chastised him in December for eating in the players’ cafeteria as he’d done since his arrival in 2017. “In short, every African American in the building understood that not too many of us could congregate or be seen interacting with each other even during lunch because it did not look good to the powers that be,” Pope alleged. Pope said the reason he was given for his termination was the lack of a background in law enforcement. “I believe I was discriminated against and terminated on the basis of my race and color,” Pope wrote. Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the EEOC will investigate a charge of discrimination that could make a determination that discrimination took place – which would lead to mediation – or the federal agency could sue the employer. The person who makes a complaint can sue the employer if the EEOC doesn’t find a “reasonable cause to believe discrimination occurred,” according to the agency’s website. "I was going to handle this the way I handle most of my claims: quietly,” N. Lucy Chukwurah, Pope’s attorney, told The Houston Chronicle. “When the Texans terminated Mr. Gaine, that caught my attention. They terminated him a few days after they spoke with their counsel. I found that to be unusual."
Washington (CNN)Some federal law enforcement officials are warning of a chilling effect inside the FBI amid attacks by President Donald Trump and Attorney General William Barr over the bureau's handling of the Russia investigation.Current and former FBI officials tell CNN they're concerned that the harsh rhetoric coming from Trump and Barr has only worsened the bureau's already tenuous standing with the President, leaving them wondering whether federal agents could be less aggressive the next time they have to pursue a sensitive investigation."We're constantly told to be agile and use all the legal tools available to us," said one FBI employee who works on counterintelligence matters. "But who is going to risk sticking their neck out now only to have DOJ chop it off?"Barr this week seized on findings in a blockbuster inspector general report to scold the FBI for using "intrusive" tools with only "flimsy" evidence, and he questioned whether they'd been motivated by bias. Those attacks were particularly noteworthy given that the report found no evidence of bias or improper motivation in the FBI's decisions to use counterintelligence techniques. The report did however point out serious mistakes and mishandling of evidence by the FBI.In his criticism, Barr has used language that hews closely to conspiracies from Trump, who maintains that his campaign was illegally spied on. During a rally on Tuesday night, Trump used the word "scum" to refer to FBI employees he believes acted improperly."These comments will have a chilling effect on the workforce," said one recently retired agent who has handled surveillance warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the kind abused according to the inspector general report.Investigative toolsIf there are more administrative hurdles, and concern that actions will be second-guessed, agents may decide to avoid certain investigative tools, the former agent said. That includes pursuing things like FISA warrants to surveil targets, a process that is frequently used by investigators, but was riddled with errors during the Russia investigation, the inspector general found.As they sought to determine if members of the Trump campaign were colluding with the Russian government in the run-up to the 2016 election, FBI officials in Washington turned to what were standard measures for the bureau but that were used in extraordinary circumstances to investigate a presidential campaign.Informants were deployed to meet and record conversations with certain campaign aides, and FISA warrants targeted Carter Page, a onetime foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, allowing the FBI to eavesdrop on his calls and look back on his messages.While he found no evidence of political bias in the FBI's investigation, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz called out "failure" among the ranks of the FBI for making a number of "basic and fundamental errors" as they sought permission to obtain the FISA warrants.On Wednesday Horowitz criticized the application process for the FISA warrants on Page. "Let me put it this way, I would not have submitted the one they put in," Horowitz said.Barr, in an interview with NBC News Tuesday, heightened the failure to an accusation of civil liberties abuse."The greatest danger to our free system is that the incumbent government use the apparatus of the state, principally the law enforcement agencies and the intelligence agencies, both to spy on political opponents, but also to use them in a way that could affect the outcome of the election," Barr said.As the head of the Justice Department, Barr is two steps above the FBI's director, Christopher Wray, and defenders of the agency have called Barr's pejorative use of the term "spying" inappropriate."For the boss of the boss of the FBI director to be criticizing how the FBI does that and to use those types of terms is not helpful," said Robert Anderson, a former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence who signed off on numerous FISA warrants before becoming a top executive under former director James Comey.Barr was looking at the situation through a political lens, rather than strictly at the facts of the case, Anderson said.He disagreed, however, that the political rhetoric could impede the work of rank and file agents."I don't know if it has a chilling effect at the workforce level because most of the men and women, analysts and linguists, are not tied to any of the political nonsense at headquarters," Anderson said.Ignoring the criticismAgents and employees in the field have tried to ignore the political criticism and constant headlines, and some are disappointed in the actions of past FBI leadership, an agent told CNN."We want to be proud of our agency," the agent said, but after more than two years "we don't have time to dwell on it."Agents continue to work their cases, putting in long hours, the agent said.One of the concerns arising from the internal watchdog investigation is the finding of what the inspector general said were a series of missteps up and down the FBI chain of command, despite the fact officials knew the case was going to be highly scrutinized."You had the highest levels of the organization working on this, and they made such epic failures that they're going to bring down the entire organization because of the incompetence in how they did their jobs," the retired agent said.FBI agents and employees are often accused of having swagger, viewing themselves as better investigators than those from other government agencies.The problems identified in the inspector general report, along with the attacks from political leaders, hurts that pride, current and former employees say.In a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Republican chairman Lindsey Graham seized on these failures in questioning Horowitz, asking him whether they representative of the bureau on the whole"I certainly hope that that is not the way others are following these practices," Horowitz said.Wray's responseFBI Director Wray has sought to support the agency in the aftermath of the report with a video message that went out to staff and a letter that was sent to former employees.In a series of interviews on Monday, Wray also pointed to the fact that Horowitz found that the investigation was properly opened, though he called the problems identified in the report "unacceptable and unrepresentative of who we are as an institution."In a response included in the report, Wray described more than 40 steps the FBI was taking to address recommendations made by the inspector general, including changes to make the processes for seeking FISA warrants "more stringent and less susceptible to mistake or inaccuracy."At the oversight hearing Wednesday, Graham, a close Republican ally of the President, suggested a broader overhaul of the FISA system would be necessary if law enforcement wanted to keep the power."I would hate to lose the ability of the FISA court to operate at a time probably when we need it the most. But after your report, I have serious concerns about whether the FISA court can continue unless there is fundamental reform," Graham said.David Szady, a second former assistant director for counterintelligence at the FBI, underscored the value that law enforcement derives from FISA surveillance, but agreed that more oversight to that tool and others used by investigators in the Russia probe was a good thing."They're just so intrusive. You're talking about using techniques, whether they're human sources or technical sources, against a US citizen, so you want to make sure your information is as solid as possible," Szady said.
Last year at AWS re:invent, the company’s massive customer conference, Amazon launched a new miniature race car and a racing league, all designed to teach developers about machine learning in a fun way. Today, ahead of next week’s re:Invent conference, the company announced some enhancements including an improved car and expanded racing schedule.“We are adding more chances to compete at AWS events and at your own events, more chances to win with new races, including head-to-head multi-car competitions, and an upgraded DeepRacer car with new sensing capabilities,” AWS’s Jeff Barr wrote in the company blog announcing the updates.For starters, there is a new car called DeepRacer Evo that builds on the original model that came out last year. This one includes a new stereo camera and a Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensor. Barr says these added sensors are more than window dressing.“The added sensors will enable DeepRacer Evo to skillfully detect and respond to obstacles, including other DeepRacers. This will help you to learn even more about the exciting field of reinforcement learning, which is ideal for use in autonomous driving,” he wrote.You can retro fit your existing car with a sensor upgrade kit, or buy a new DeepRacer Evo. Both will be available early next year, according to the company.One added element in offering a car like this is building in competition, and that’s where the racing league comes in. The company plans to expand the opportunities to compete next year with more races — and they are expanding the race types. While last year the races were all about speed, they are adding two new categories next year including one to take advantage of the new sensors to detect and avoid obstacles, and head-to-head racing against other cars. Last year’s race involved a single car on the track competing to get the fastest time.As Ryan Gavin, AWS general manager for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning marketing told TechCrunch’s Frederic Lardinois earlier this year, this is really about helping developers learn more about advanced technologies.“We’ve always asked ourselves what are the ways we can take interesting and new and hot technologies in the world of machine learning and find ways to bring those to developers,” he told Lardinois. He added, “And we saw them instantly playing with these deep racers and then starting to race. And it was just kind of that little moment of ‘Oh, this is a really fun and peculiar way to extend what we think is an interesting way to bring reinforcement learning to developers,’ but then extend that to this idea of a competition — this first global autonomous racing league — where developer can pit their skills against one another from around the globe.”Next week at re:Invent, there will plenty of DeepRacer action including the league qualifying races and the championship cup competition for folks already immersed in this. For those who want to learn more or get started, AWS will offer DeepRacer bootcamps and workshops.
(CNN)Michael Bloomberg kicked off his presidential campaign this week with a television ad blitz that gobbled up a stunning amount of airtime in major media markets around the country and in a number of smaller swing states.The spot is mostly unremarkable: It talks up Bloomberg's biography, business success, philanthropy and paints a pleasant portrait of his record as mayor of New York City. But there is a sharp signal of intent baked into the otherwise gauzy introduction -- one that gets at the fierce rift within the Democratic Party as it prepares for 2020, with Bloomberg and other more industry-friendly, centrist candidates on one side and progressive populists like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on the other."Everyone without health insurance is guaranteed to get it, and everyone who likes theirs can go ahead and keep it," the ad says -- an indirect if obvious attack on "Medicare for All," the single-payer health care plan, and political flashpoint, that would ultimately eliminate private insurers.Bloomberg is a longshot to win or meaningfully compete for the Democratic nomination, but his decision to run immediately blew open the party's battle over the influence of money, and the wealthiest Americans, on the political system. For Sanders and Warren, Bloomberg's campaign brings with it both an opportunity to sharpen their messages and an existential new threat: a billionaire prepared to reach deep into his near bottomless pockets in an effort to derail them, their agenda and a style of politics that more deeply engages the electorate.The progressive senators, who have forsworn big dollar contributions, condemned Bloomberg out of the gate, with Sanders last week calling the billionaire businessman's initial outlay an attempt to "circumvent the political process." Absent grassroots support, Sanders said, candidates like Bloomberg had "no business running for president." Bloomberg has said he won't take any donations, a step to signal his independence, but one that his rivals argue effectively cuts him off from accountability to voters.A few days later, Warren took the unusual-for-her step of calling out Bloomberg by name in Iowa."I am here on Day 2 of Michael Bloomberg's $37 million ad buy," Warren said to laughter in Ankeny on Monday. "Michael Bloomberg is making a bet about democracy in 2020 -- he doesn't need people, he only needs bags and bags of money."Contrasting her grassroots-style campaign with Bloomberg's plans to bombard the airwaves, Warren laid out the progressive movement's view of the fight at hand.The question, she said, is "which vision of our democracy, which version of our democracy, is going to win. And if Michael Bloomberg's version of democracy wins, then democracy changes and it's going to be about which billionaire you can stomach going forward."Warren's team took her remarks and cut them into an online video, which it tweeted out a few hours later. Online, at the campaign store, her "Billionaire Tears" mug is still for sale.Meanwhile, in New Hampshire, Sanders kept up his own attacks on Bloomberg."I understand the power of the '1%,'" he said at a rally in New Hampshire. "You're seeing that right now literally with Mayor Bloomberg, who has decided to use part of his 55 billion dollars not to buy a yacht, not to buy another home, not to buy a fancy car, but to buy the United States government."The Democratic Party has, over decades, become more and more welcoming, and in many cases dependent, on contributions from big business interests and wealthy donors. Even amid a progressive resurgence that has made it less politically palatable for Democrats to accept money from corporate PACs or lobbyists, billionaires like Bloomberg -- who has given prodigiously to an assortment of liberal causes, most notably in forming his gun control organization -- have largely avoided the scorn directed at conservative benefactors like the Koch Brothers.Tom Steyer, the other billionaire vying for the nomination, effectively bought his way onto the debate stage by paying for ads soliciting donations. But his smaller fortune -- in the most relative terms -- and lower national profile has made him a less appealing foil for progressive activists, who in many cases have come to see him as a reliable ally.Bloomberg does not have the same kind of cred. His no-donor pledge, which follows a blueprint similar to the one he followed during his time as mayor, has only stoked anger on the left."I will be the only candidate in this race who isn't corruptible, who isn't going to take a penny from anyone, and will work for a dollar a year," he said in Phoenix on Tuesday, after filing for Arizona's state primary. But for progressives critics, including Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir, that misses the point.Bloomberg "says, 'Oh, I'm not going to take a salary because I can't be bought," Shakir said during a livestreamed briefing for supporters later on Tuesday. "Well, that's just because you're not accountable to the American people."New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who in her famous 2018 viral ad said her primary against one of the party's most formidable fundraisers was "about people versus money: we've got people, they've got money," put Bloomberg at the center of a recent fundraising appeal for Sanders."Bloomberg is launching his presidential bid. His plan? Dump piles of cash on the media. Typical billionaire move," she wrote, the email's subject line filled only with an eye-roll emoji, before offering a sense of just how much Bloomberg was spending. "Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders would need 1.7 million of us to donate his average contribution -- $18 -- to match one week of Bloomberg's TV buy."Sanders and Warren have both rooted their campaigns in an argument that, as Warren puts it, "the wealthy and well-connected" hold an outsize and insidiously damaging grip on elections and the actions -- or inaction -- of government.In a February speech inaugurating her presidential bid, Warren laid blame for the historic levels of economic inequality at the feet of the "richest and most powerful people in America." She also predicted, with history as her guide, how the pushback to her message would sound."When I talk about this stuff, someone screams 'class warfare,'" Warren said. "Well let me tell you something. These same rich guys have been waging class warfare against hard-working people for decades. I say it's time to fight back."Sanders, who has been campaigning against "the billionaire class" for decades, made the point bluntly in an August tweet."If there is going to be class warfare in this country," Sanders wrote, "it's about time the working class won that war."Micah Uetricht, an editor at Jacobin, the socialist magazine, grabbed and reproduced the tweet in sticker form, selling 500 within 24 hours and donating the proceeds -- after printing up another thousand -- to the campaign. A few months later, this past Sunday, the Sanders team in a fundraising email offered up a similar deal to a much wider audience."Contribute any amount," they wrote to supporters, "and get our 'Class Warfare' sticker."
A former senior North Korean diplomat has apologised for saying Kim Jong-un was likely so ill 'he cannot stand up by himself or walk properly' just three days before the dictator was seen smoking a cigarette at a public event.North Korea's former deputy ambassador to Britain, Thae Yong Ho, told CNN  Kim's 'abnormal' absence from a ruling party showpiece on April 15 signalled the dictator must be physically impaired. Thae fled to South Korea in 2016 and was one of two defectors elected to parliament last month. In a statement he said he felt 'blame and heavy responsibility' for making his unfounded claims.'I am aware that one of the reasons why many of you voted for me as a lawmaker is with the expectations of an accurate analysis and projections on North Korean issues', he said. 'Whatever the reasons, I apologise to everyone.' Kim disappeared from state media for weeks, sparking a flurry of speculation about his health and whereabouts, and worry about prospects for the nuclear-armed state in the event of an unexpected succession.But on Saturday, North Korean media published photographs of Kim at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the inauguration of a fertiliser plant.His re-emergence came as a blow to the credibility of some high-profile defectors from the North who had speculated that Kim was suffering from a grave illness or could even be dead.  The other prominent defector elected to parliament, Ji Seong-ho, said in a media interview he was 99 per cent certain that Kim had died after cardiovascular surgery and an official announcement would come as soon as Saturday.Ji, who was invited to attend US President Donald Trump's State of the Union address in 2018, could not be reached on Monday.On Friday he said he had received information about Kim's death from a source he could not disclose. He added he ran for office to bring attention to human rights abuse in the North.  South Korea's ruling Democratic Party criticised the pair for carelessness that it said could do more serious than just misinforming the public.One party member said they should be excluded from the intelligence and defence committees.Daily NK, a South Korean news outlet run by North Korean defectors, reported in April that Kim was recovering from a cardiovascular procedure, sparking international speculation about his health.But a senior South Korean government official told reporters today that the presidential office does not believe the authoritarian leader underwent an operation, according to the Yonhap News Agency.The news from South Korea came as the two neighbours exchanged gunfire along the border, just a day after Kim's reappearance.Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said he believed the timing of the 'grey area' provocation shows it could been planned to show that Kim was still in charge of the North Korean military. 'Yesterday, Kim was trying to show he is perfectly healthy, and today, Kim is trying to mute all kinds of speculation that he may not have full control over the military,' Choi said.'Rather than going all the way by firing missiles and supervising a missile launch, Kim could be reminding us, ''yes I'm healthy and I'm still in power''.' An unnamed senior official at the South's presidential office said: 'Chairman Kim is not believed to have received surgery.'There were media reports speculating about Kim's surgery, citing a change in the way he walks,' the official added, saying Seoul had enough grounds to draw the conclusion.    North Korean troops fired multiple gunshots towards the South in the Demilitarized Zone dividing the peninsula early on Sunday, prompting South Korean forces to fire back.The gunfire broke out between the two nations when North Korea fired a series of shots towards a guard post in South Korea that borders the North at 7.41am local time, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staffs (JCS) said.The JCS in Seoul said in a statement today that the guard post was hit by several shots from the North.Kim was last seen in public on April 11, when he presided over a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party in Pyongyang. On April 15, he inexplicably missed a Day of the Sun celebration honouring his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, the founder of North Korea. His unprecedented absence sparked a wave of speculation about his health, and he was not seen in public for 20 days.On Friday, May 1, the despot made his first public appearance after his absence, when he cut the ribbon at the opening of a fertiliser factory in Sunchon. Before Kim's reappearance, vice director of Hong Kong Satellite Television Shijian Xingzou claimed he was dead. Officials in South Korea and the US were sceptical.  The former top US diplomat for East Asia Daniel Russel said the pieces of the puzzle of Kim's disappearance would take time to assemble.His public appearance showed authoritative information about the well-being and whereabouts of a North Korean leader were very closely guarded, and rumours about him needed to be regarded with considerable skepticism, Russel said.The rumours had, however, served to focus attention on North Korea's succession plan, which 'in a monarchical and cult-like dictatorship is filled with risk, and the absence of a designated adult heir compounds that risk many times over,' Russel said.Earlier, a source familiar with US intelligence analyses and reporting said US agencies believed Kim was not ill and remained very much in power.'We think he's still in charge,' the source said on condition of anonymity. The source could not immediately confirm the KCNA report. The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. South Korean Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees engagement with Pyongyang, said it was plausible Kim was absent as a precaution over the coronavirus pandemic, in view of the stringent steps taken to head off an outbreak in the country.Harry Kazianis, senior director of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington, said this still could be the case.He said: 'The most likely explanation for Kim's absence is with North Korea declaring the coronavirus pandemic an existential threat... he most likely was taking steps to ensure his health or may have been impacted in some way personally by the virus.'In his appearance at the fertiliser factory, Kim expressed satisfaction about the production system and said the plant made a significant contribution to the progress of the country's chemical industry and food production, KCNA said. Marks on Kim's wrist seen as he sat on a golf cart at the factory suggest he could have had heart surgery, medical experts claimed.  The experts assessed video footage of the visit and claimed marks on Kim's arms showed he has had a 'cardiovascular procedure', US-funded NK News reported.   What appeared to be needle marks could be seen on his wrists while he rode in a golf cart that looked a lot like the one he used in 2014, when he returned to the public eye with a cane after some time away. Asked about the KCNA report, US President Donald Trump said: 'I'd rather not comment on it yet. We'll have something to say about it at the appropriate time.' Memes surfaced across social media in the West in response to the report that the dictator has been out and about.One said 'Kim Jong-Un with the best comeback of 2020', while another posted a picture comparing the dictator to the wrestler the Undertaker. A man wrote 'so Kim Jong-Un is alive and well' above a picture of Spiderman looking unsure.While another added 'North Korean state media release photo of Kim Jong-Un' with a picture a man being held up by two others.The news appears to fly in the face of a report earlier on Friday from a North Korean defector claiming he was '99 per cent sure' Kim was dead.Ji claimed to South Korea's Yonhap news agency he had been 'told Kim died last weekend' after cardiovascular surgery.The defector said Kim's sister Kim Yo-jong was in line to succeed her brother but said the secretive state was 'grappling with a complicated succession issue'. State-controlled media in North Korea had not provided any definitive proof Kim was alive.But there was a sign of life earlier on Friday as Daily NK reported the regime had issued a directive signed by Kim himself, the first in two weeks.Ji suggested Kim might have died after heart surgery. 'I've wondered how long he could have endured after cardiovascular surgery. I've been informed that Kim died last weekend,' he said.'It is not 100 per cent certain, but I can say the possibility is 99 per cent. North Korea is believed to be grappling with a complicated succession issue.'Pyongyang has never made any succession plans public, but experts say Kim's sister has been the most visible presence around the dictator in recent years.She was named an alternate member of the ruling Workers' Party's powerful Central Committee Politburo last month.North Korea is the world's most secretive country and reports about Kim and his family, including the suggestion he recently had heart surgery, are nearly impossible to verify.But other defectors have cast doubt on whether such sensitive information would ever leak out from Kim's inner circle.Some defectors say their relatives in North Korea did not know Kim had been missing from public view for three weeks.  One said people had been talking about Kim's whereabouts in very private circles after he failed to appear at the ruling party showpiece on April 15.Kim's unprecedented absence from the Day of the Sun ceremony honouring his grandfather prompted the major speculation about his welfare.Defector Lee Soon-hee said: 'I talked to my sister and my niece this morning and they had no clue about these reports and rumours about Kim Jong Un's health.'When I told them, they were so cautious about discussing it. North Koreans have a very limited knowledge of these things.' Lee defected to the South in 2009.North Koreans are keenly aware they could face punishment for discussing the Kim family, said Sokeel Park, of Liberty in North Korea, a group that works with defectors.He said: 'That doesn't mean people don't take that risk, some people do. But it's still a super sensitive issue. It's a little like the pope not showing up for Christmas,' he said of Kim's absence from the April 15 celebrations.South Korean officials say they have not detected any 'unusual movements' north of the demilitarised zone.The South's minister in charge of North Korean affairs said on Tuesday fear of coronavirus could have kept Kim away from the April 15 ceremony.President Trump said yesterday: 'I understand what is going on, I cannot just talk about him right now, just hoping that everything will be fine. But I do understand the situation very well'.Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has said he was aware of reports on Kim's health and was paying close attention to developments.Still, experts said it was strange North Korea had not quickly release a picture of a healthy-looking Kim if there was no truth to the rumours.Official media has not provided any verifiable proof of life since April 11, other than reporting he had sent messages to North Korean workers and to South Africa's president Cyril Ramaphosa and the pictures of him in Sunchon.The other defector, Thae,  warned only a small handful of people would know the full story.He also cautioned clues about Kim's whereabouts - such as an apparent sighting of his personal train in the city of Wonsan - could be deliberate diversion tactics.Pyongyang officials know the train can be seen from satellites and have previously sent it around the country to confuse outsiders, Thae said.The sighting of the train was followed by further satellite images from Wonsan showing boats often used by Kim and his entourage.North Korea has never announced who would succeed Kim Jong Un in the event he is incapacitated and with no details known about his young children, analysts say his sister and loyalists could form a regency until a successor is old enough to take over.Each change at the top in North Korea has raised the prospect of a leadership vacuum or collapse of the Kim dynasty, which has ruled the country since its founding in 1948.So far, each of the three Kims to rule North Korea has defied expectations, holding on to power with an iron grip.But under Kim Jong Un, North Korea's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles has grown substantially, raising concerns over who would control them.In the event of any leadership transition, Kim Jong Un's younger sister Kim Yo Jong is likely to play a central part.In the past two years, Yo Jong has risen quickly through North Korea's leadership hierarchy, serving officially as a vice director of the Workers' Party's powerful Central Committee, but also unofficially as her brother's chief of staff.Kim Yo Jong, who is believed to be 31, has a firm control of key party functions, setting herself to be the main source of power behind a collective leadership.She has regularly been observed at her brother's side, leading South Korean Media to dub her the 'Ivanka Trump of North Korea'.'Kim Yo Jong will be for the time being the main power base with control of the organisation and guidance department, the judiciary and public security,' said Cho Han-bum of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a government-funded think-tank in Seoul.Still, relatively little is known of of Kim Yo Jong. The dictator's younger sibling has routinely kept a low profile, having only made her first public statement last month, in which she mocked South Korea as being a 'frightening dog barking', for opposing a live-fire military demonstration.But sources say Yo Jong's work behind the scenes suggests she would rule with the same iron-fist as her predecessors, should she be announced leader, temporarily or otherwise.Along with several other North Korean officials, Kim Yo Jong was blacklisted by the US Treasury Department for 'severe human rights abuses' in 2017.She also incurred a reputation for her aggressive propaganda pushing, regarded a one of the main officials who worked to enact 'rigid censorship policies and conceals its inhumane and oppressive behavior'.'Among the North's power elite, Kim Yo Jong has the highest chance to inherit power, and I think that possibility is more than 90 per cent,' an analyst said.Yo Jong first began working in the ruling party in 2007, but in the last few years she has 'gotten a lot more serious' about the role she's playing, government consultant Michael Madden told the New Yorker.'When you see footage of her on the receiving lines, she is smiling, a nice friendly young woman, but when she is out of those lines, the smile vanishes and she even looks like Kim Jong Il,' Madden remarked.Should she be announced as ruler, Yo Jong would become North Korea's first female leader since her Grandfather Kim Il-Sung founded the nation in 1948.   In the event of Kim Jong Un's death, party Elders Choe Ryong Hae and Pak Pong Ju would likely find themselves at Yo Jong's side, helping to weather any leadership storm.Ryong Hae was announced as North Korea's nominal head of state last when he rose to become president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, following decades of service within the party for the ruing Kim family.Choe and Pak Pong Ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North's push to introduce more free-market functions to revive its economy, are likely to be the figureheads leading a collective leadership, analysts say.Unlikely to emerge as a major presence is Kim Jong Un's estranged older brother, Kim Jong Chol, who has not been a part of the country's leadership instead opting for a quite life away from politics playing music.Though according to North Korea's former deputy ambassador in London, who has since defected to the South, Jong Chol does maintain ties with his siblings and could play a more public role in any contingency plans.Kim Jong Un is believed to have three children with Ri Sol Ju, the youngest born in 2017, according to the South's National Intelligence Service.The oldest is a 10-year-old son, meaning any of the three would need the assistance of their relatives or political guardians if they were to become a fourth-generation hereditary leader.Kim Jong Il had been groomed for 20 years to lead the country, while Kim Jong Un had just over a year to prepare, due to his father's sudden death from a heart attack.Go Myong-hyun, a research fellow at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul, said: 'Kim Yo Jong is unlikely to take over the helm but could help build a caretaker regime as a power broker until the kids grow up, and Kim Jong Chol might return to help for a while.'This is not the first time Kim has disappeared from the public eye. In 2014, Kim was not seen for 40 days, before he reemerged appearing to walk with a limp and using a cane, after he reportedly suffered from an ankle problem.His father Kim Jong-il disappeared from view for months in 2008, prompting speculation that he had a stroke. A French doctor later confirmed the reports, and the then leader died three years later.But North Korea's ruling elite have vanished from the spotlight before prompting rumors of their death only to re-emerge seemingly unscathed.In 2015 it was claimed by a North Korean defector Kim ordered his own aunt to be killed by poison. The aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, re-appeared smiling in January.A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea last month, two of the people said. The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier last month Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea.South Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the Liaison Department challenged subsequent reports suggesting Kim was in grave danger after surgery. South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.North Korea is one of the world's most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm any details on Kim's whereabouts or condition.North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. State media did not report he was in attendance at an event to mark the birthday of his grandfather - an important anniversary in North Korea.Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.When Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong Il suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, an impoverished state that depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.China is North Korea's chief ally and the economic lifeline for a country hard-hit by U.N. sanctions, and has a keen interest in the stability of the country with which it shares a long, porous border.Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. He has visited China four times since 2018.Trump held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea's nuclear arsenal.'The North Korean version of Undertaker': Internet reacts to claims Kim Jong-un is alive after photos of dictator are released for the first time in 20 days following rumours he had diedTwitter users rejoiced following the return to public life of North Korean despot Kim Jong-un. Several reports from the hermit state suggested Kim, who is believed to be in his late 30s, could have undergone major surgery or even possibly died.  He had not been seen in public since April 11 and missed the national celebrations for his grandfather and founder of North Korea, Kim Il Sung on April 15. However, North Korea's state news agency KCNA released photographs of a smiling Kim inspecting a fertiliser plant outside Pyongyang. The report said Kim cut a ribbon as the crowd 'burst into thunderous cheers of 'hurrah!' for the Supreme Leader...'. Twitter users questioned the authenticity of the photographs, with memes ripped from The Simpsons and Weekend at Bernies.  Kim was seen in photographs smiling and talking to aides at the ribbon-cutting ceremony and also touring the plant. The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be verified.Many in the large crowd of people, described as officials of the army, the ruling party and the community who worked on the project, were wearing face masks and standing some distance from the podium where Kim and his aides took part in the ceremony.North Korea has not reported any cases of the coronavirus and has said it has been taking tough measures to prevent an outbreak. One reason for Kim's absence has been the suggestion he may have been taking precautions against coronavirus.Kim was accompanied by senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yo Jong and top aides vice-chairman Pak Pong Ju of the State Affairs Commission and cabinet premier Kim Jae Ryong, and KCNA said.Asked about the KCNA report on Kim, U.S. President Donald Trump said: 'I'd rather not comment on it yet.''We'll have something to say about it at the appropriate time,' he told reporters at the White House. Speculation about Kim's health has been rife after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15. The day is a major holiday in North Korea and Kim as leader usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state.He last made a public appearance on April 11 attending a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party politburo.Following his absence from the anniversary, a South Korean news outlet specialising on the North reported that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure. A flurry of other unconfirmed reports about his condition and his whereabouts followed.Officials in South Korea and the United States expressed scepticism about the reports.State TV footage on Saturday showed Kim's leg movements appearing stiff and jerky and one of the images showed a green golf cart in the background, similar to one he used in 2014 after a lengthy public absence.       
Skygazers can look forward to seeing several shooting stars tonight, as the Earth passes through the dust left over from Halley’s Comet.The Eta Aquariid meteor shower is expected to peak on the night of May 5, with up to 40 meteors per hour, and will be visible until the early morning of May 6.This celestial display is associated with the Halley’s Comet, officially designated 1P/Halley, which orbits the sun once every 76 years.Tania de Sales Marques, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told the PA news agency: “The last time it [Halley’s Comet] was seen in the sky was 1986, and our next chance to view it will be late in the year 2061.”The Eta Aquariids takes its name from the constellation of Aquarius in the southern hemisphere, where the shooting stars appear to originate from.Meteoroids from Halley’s Comet strike the Earth’s atmosphere at an approximate speed of 150,000 miles per hour (240,000kph), burning up in the process.Ms de Sales Marques said: “As a comet approaches the sun it heats up, releasing gas and dust into space behind it.“When that wake of debris intersects with the orbit of the Earth we experience meteor showers, as the particles fall towards the Earth and heat up upon entering the atmosphere, leaving bright streaks in the sky as they vaporise or break apart.”While the Eta Aquariids is active from late April to near the end of May, Ms de Sales Marques says the best time to see it will be on the night of May 5-6 between midnight and sunrise, when the shower will be at its peak.She said: “This is a moderately active meteor shower, with a peak rate of 40 meteors per hour, and even though its radiant will be below or only just above the horizon for those of us at London’s latitude, we can still look out for its meteors all across the sky.“Our best chance will be in the hours just before dawn, facing the eastern sky.”She advises getting far away from all artificial lights to increase the chances of catching a glimpse of the shooting stars on a moonlit night.Ms de Sales Marques said: “As with any other stargazing activity, the best way to see meteors is to find yourself a spot sheltered from city lights with an unobstructed view of the sky and look in the direction of the radiant.“The moon will be waxing gibbous throughout the night, so the sky won’t be as dark as one could hope, adding to the challenge.” 
PARIS/BAMAKO (Reuters) - France will never secure total victory over Islamist insurgents in West Africa, its top general said on Wednesday, after 13 soldiers died in a helicopter crash during a combat mission in Mali, France’s worst single loss of troops for 36 years.General Francois Lecointre said France’s military role in the Sahel region south of the Sahara was “useful, good and necessary”, but it was hard to see the moment when the war would finally be won.The remarks could embolden opponents of President Emmanuel Macron, in particular on the far-left, who are demanding France plots a way out of the conflict.“We will never achieve a definitive victory,” Lecointre, chief of staff of the armed forces, told France Inter radio.The 13 French soldiers were killed in Mali on Monday when two helicopters collided in the dark after being called in to provide air support during a combat mission to track down a band of Islamic State militant fighters.One source said the operation was in reaction to an attack in Indelimane, Menaka region, in late October that killed at least 53 Malian soldiers and was claimed by Islamic State.France intervened in Mali in 2013 to repel insurgents advancing out of northern strongholds into central Mali. There are now 4,500 French troops in the wider region, as part of “operation Barkhane”, named for a crescent-shaped sand dune.However, Islamist militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have strengthened their foothold. Swathes of the arid Sahel region are ungovernable.“We’re getting results but we have to be patient and persevering,” Lecointre said.The two black boxes from the Tiger attack helicopter and the Cougar multipurpose helicopter have been recovered, military officials said, and will be central to the investigation into how the accident occurred.“RED ZONE”The defence minister, Florence Parly, arrived in Mali to pay tribute to the soldiers who died. France hopes to repatriate the soldiers’ bodies in the days ahead.Ground commandos had been tracking the group of militants through harsh terrain for several days before making contact on Monday in the Valley of Eranga, central Mali. Air support was called in after a gun-battle erupted.One local resident described the region where the collision occurred as lawless and overrun by jihadists.“We call it the red zone. No-one dares wander that way,” the resident said, declining to be identified for fear of retribution.The area has been a focal point for recent French operations against Islamic State affiliated militants, according to Menastream, a risk consultancy group that monitors jihadist activity in the region.France has complained to European allies that it is bearing the brunt of a counter-terrorism operation that benefits all Europe.In June, amid a spike in militant attacks, France urged European powers to provide special forces to support the G5 Sahel force - made up of thousands of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania - as it struggled to contain a rise in violence.Commitments so far had been minimal and the deaths of the French troops would not encourage more, one western diplomat in West Africa said.“No European government is keen on body bags,” the diplomat said.
Whether you’re getting married or moving in with your partner, some of the biggest relationship milestones come with substantial price tags. That could include the cost of a wedding, furniture for a new apartment or even just spending more on your weekly grocery bill now that you’re shopping for two. And with these bills should come conversations about how you want to manage your money as a couple and if that should include sharing a credit card.But is it a good idea to open a joint card? Or is it smarter to add your partner as an authorized user? Below, CNBC Select spoke to four financial experts who weighed in on if it’s a good idea to share a credit card with your spouse.Bryan Kuderna, author of “Millennial Millionaire”It can be beneficial for a couple to share a credit card if one has a great credit history and the other has what they call a “thin file,” Bryan Kuderna, a certified financial planner with the Kuderna Financial Team, tells CNBC Select.A “thin file” simply means that you don’t have a good credit score because you don’t have much credit history. You don’t have bad financial habits, per se, but you’re penalized because you haven’t had the opportunity to build credit yet, Kuderna says.Sharing a credit card can help the partner with the lower credit score start to build their credit and raise their score.There are two options for sharing a card, Kuderna explains. You can open a joint card or have the spouse with the lower credit score become an authorized user on the other’s credit card. Just be aware that some credit cards charge a fee for authorized users.The Platinum Card® from American Express, for example, charges $175 annually for up to three additional Platinum Cards and $0 for additional American Express® Gold Cards. (See rates and fees.)Credit cards that don’t charge authorized user fees include: Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card, Bank of America® Cash Rewards credit card and Citi® Double Cash Card.Even if you decide to share a card with your partner, it’s important to still hang onto your individual cards, especially those you’ve had for a while, Kuderna says. Closing your oldest credit card can negatively impact your credit score.He also recommends that his clients consider co-mingling their finances including opening joint savings and checking accounts, while keeping their credit cards separate. Sharing a bank account is a good way to hold one another accountable for all your expenditures, he says. Being transparent is important to have a happy marriage.Erin Lowry, author of “Broke Millennial Takes On Investing”Sharing a credit card with your spouse can, in many cases, streamline the budget process in your household, says Erin Lowry, founder of Broke Millennial. But she argues it’s important to know how much each person is charging on the credit card, especially if the card has a lower credit limit.“If both of you are charging purchases it could potentially drive up your utilization, and therefore impact your credit scores,” Lowry says. “If you have a $3,000 limit and you each spent $1,000 on it in a month, that’s too high a utilization ratio since the optimal is using no more than 30% of the available credit limit.”For those opening a credit card solely to maximize the rewards or travel points they could earn, Lowry says that it doesn’t usually make sense to add a partner as an authorized user. “Instead, it would be better to stagger opening your own cards to take advantage of sign-up bonuses,” she says.Wilson Muscadin, founder at The Money SpeakeasyWhen it comes to sharing a credit card with your spouse, opening a joint card has more drawbacks than benefits, argues Wilson Muscadin, financial coach and founder at The Money Speakeasy, a personal finance blog for young professionals. The better option is to set them up as an authorized user.For one, card issuers consider the lowest credit score when looking at a joint application, which can result in higher interest rates and lower credit limits.Also, sharing a card gets murky if you end up getting separated or divorced, Muscadin says. Both people on the joint account are fully legally responsible for the remaining balance on the account if it were closed. “From the card issuer’s perspective, they’re not concerned about a divorce or a separation issue — both parties are fully responsible for whatever happened on that account. The original contract from that account stands,” he says.“The only way to get yourself off of that account is to fully pay the balance, or do a balance transfer, and then close the account,” Muscadin says. “The account can’t be disjointed once it’s set up as a joint account.”If you want to share a card with your partner, Muscadin recommends going the authorized user route — in part because you can remove the extra name from the account at any time.But choosing to add a partner as an authorized users is still a big decision. That cardholder is legally responsible for any debt, and it’s their credit score that’s dinged if there’s a missed payment.Priya Malani, founding partner at Stash Wealth“Yes, we do like spouses/partners, to share a credit card,” Priya Malani, a founding partner of Stash Wealth, a millennial-focused financial-planning firm, tells CNBC Select.But before you open a joint credit card, Malani says it is really important to know your partner’s money habits. You also want to know if your partner is charging their work or business expenses onto the credit card.“You should resolve that before you begin sharing a credit card with your significant other,” Malani says. “Because then it gets very, very confusing: ‘Is this a bill we can pay off at the end of the month? Is some of this getting reimbursed through your company? Speaking of reimbursement, did you put your expenses through this week?’” You don’t want to be nagging each other.Malani also recommends outlining how much you and your partner spend together in various categories (such as gas and groceries) in order to choose the credit card that gets you the most bang for your buck.When it comes to paying the credit card’s annual fee, teaming up with a partner might make good financial sense. Rather than paying two annual fees, you’ll be paying an annual fee plus an authorized user fee, which ends up costing less.“For example, the Chase Sapphire Reserve® has a $450 annual fee, but to add an authorized user, it’s $75,” says Malani. “So instead of both of you paying $450 for an annual fee, you’re paying $525 [together].” (Update: The Chase Sapphire Reserve has a $550 annual fee as of January 12, 2020)It’s also essential to have a conversation about how much you can charge on the shared credit card in order to be able to pay it off at the end of the month. Malani suggests keeping the credit card’s app on your phone in order to easily track each other. “If you’re getting close to the end of the month, and you’re right at that max number that you come up with, you’re going to want to ‘Netflix and chill,’” she says.Malani encourages sharing a credit card with your partner, but says only if it is a serious relationship should you begin merging and sharing finances. But having one credit card and putting the majority of your purchases on it can really go a long way in simplifying how you track things, she says.
For the first time in 39 seasons on "Survivor," a contestant has been ejected.On Wednesday's episode of "Survivor: Island of the Idols," Dan Spilo was pulled from the competition by production for unacceptable behavior following an off-camera incident. "A decision has been made, and Dan will not be returning to the game," host Jeff Probst announced to the remaining castaways. "He won't be coming back to camp, he won't be on the jury. He's gone."At the end of the episode, a title card read: "Dan was removed from the game after a report of another incident, which happened off-camera and did not involve a player."The exact reason for Spilo's removal was not disclosed. 'Survivor': Jeff Probst, Kellee Kim address Dan Spilo's 'extremely inappropriate' behaviorSpilo has stirred controversy on this season of the CBS reality show since day one, when fellow castaway Kellee Kim complained about his "inappropriate touching."Kim's concerns boiled over on day 22 when Spilo's behavior continued and producers intervened after Kim became emotional during an interview. In an onscreen message, viewers learned that "producers met with all the players, both as a group and individually. They were cautioned about personal boundaries and reminded that producers are available to them at all times. Based on the outcome of those discussions, the game continued. In addition, producers met privately with Dan, at which time he was issued a warning for his behavior," the text continued. "Producers continue to monitor the situation." Spilo, 48, a talent manager from Los Angeles, was ultimately ejected on day 36. In a statement posted to Twitter, Kim shared her thoughts on the ousting. "While Dan’s dismissal has validated the concerns that I raised from the beginning of this season, I wish that no one else had to be subjected to this type of behavior," the statement read. "CBS and 'Survivor' were on notice of Dan’s behavior from the very first days of the game. And, as 'Survivor' fans know, shortly after I spoke up on camera, I was voted off the show."She continued, "Since then, I’ve accepted genuine, heartfelt apologies from fellow castaways, but I’ve continued to feel disappointed by how this pattern of behavior was allowed to occur for so long. While I wish many things had gone differently, I’m glad that my decision to speak up made a difference."USA TODAY has reached out to CBS for comment.After the episode aired, Probst, who also serves as the executive producer, told Entertainment Tonight that Spilo "was not happy" about being removed from the game. "We talked through everything for quite a while, and by the time he got on the boat to leave, he had calmed down and was actually very respectful as he departed," he added.Probst called this season "unprecedented.""Complex social issues were woven into the game in a way we have never seen before," he said. "With our contestants’ welfare at the forefront, we have spent a lot of time discussing every layer of the situation with human resources, diversity and inclusion representatives, show therapists, lawyers, publicists, and standards and practices. We all worked diligently throughout the entire process to make the right decisions and portray an accurate depiction of what took place. We have learned a lot, and it will inform our process moving forward."He continued: "While we still want to maintain the competitive aspect of the game, above all, we want to ensure that all players always feel safe and respected."
Union leaders have warned the government’s draft plans to get staff back to work during the coronavirus crisis “have been thrown together in a hurry” and would put people at risk.Staggered shift hours, rearranged offices, and communication over radio are proposed in draft guidelines sent to business groups, major employers and unions.An end to hot-desking, continued home working, and one-way systems in buildings also reportedly form part of proposals revealed days before Boris Johnson unveils the government’s “roadmap” out of lockdown on Sunday.But Britain’s trade union body raised “urgent concerns” about the plans, expected to be finalised in the coming days, which they said contained no requirements on employers to keep people safe at work.The TUC said ministers had made no commitment to increase enforcement to stop companies flouting the law and putting staff in danger.It noted the guidance repeatedly says ”employers should consider” actions such as enabling social distancing or providing handwashing facilities but also suggests individual employers can decide to ignore that advice.Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and business secretary Alok Sharma are said to have drawn up seven documents for different industries and settings: hotels and restaurants; work in other people’s homes; factories; working outdoors; working in vehicles; shops; and offices.The guidance, also seen by the BBC and Buzzfeed News, will reportedly urge employers to minimise the number of people using communal equipment, introduce protective screens in some situations, and put additional hygiene rules in place.Shifts and break times could be staggered to reduce crowding at entrances, workers may be told to work facing away from each other, and staff canteens might be told to shut.Office staff will be told to work from home where possible, while “critical” workers who cannot should work further apart, the plans reportedly state.Under the draft proposals, companies with more than five employees will be required to submit a written risk assessment if they wish to reopen during the pandemic.But TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said “safe working will not be guaranteed” under the plans as they stand, adding that unions could be expected to support the guidance without any recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment.Prospect union general secretary Mike Clancy added: “We all want to get back to work, but there is no point in easing the lockdown if the guidelines put people at risk, potentially causing a spike in cases and another full-scale lockdown.”John Phillips, acting general secretary of the GMB Union, said the guidance was “thrown together in a hurry and it shows”.“They cannot just flick a switch, say it’s safe to work within two metres of other people without PPE and expect them to head merrily off to work,” he said.He added unions and employers had been given only 12 hours to respond to the draft guidelines which “means crucial changes will not be made”.The criticism came after transport minister Grant Shapps outlined what the easing of the lockdown may look like over the weekend.Mr Shapps said workers who do end up heading back to their jobs may have to travel in at different times throughout the day in order to aid social distancing and give people more room on public transport.“Things like staggering work times [are] very important to avoid those morning peaks. The crushes would be completely at odds with social distancing,” he told Sky News.He also suggested trains, buses and transport interchanges could be equipped with hand sanitiser, and maintained that handwashing remains more important in preventing the spread of the disease than wearing face masks, which some countries have mandated.He also said there is no firm plan yet for when schools can reopen.“It’s no secret that of course we want kids to be able to go back to school, but I’d be over-egging it to say there’s a date in place [and] a plan.”Speaking about the government’s roadmap, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said at the daily news conference in Downing Street on Sunday evening: “We’re consulting with employers and unions, professionals and public health experts, to establish how we can ensure that we have the safest possible working environments, and the prime minister will be saying more later this week.”But he warned the public the end of lockdown would not be like “flicking a switch and going ... back to the old normal”.He said there would be “a phased approach ... which allows us to monitor the impact that those changes are having on public health”.The NHS will also begin a pilot of its new coronavirus app this week with initial trials for the contact tracing system taking place on the Isle of Wight.But the government has indicated its success depends on a very high uptake among the population. Between 50 to 60 per cent of the entire population will have to use it in order for it to have a real impact. That figure means the app will need to become as ubiquitous as WhatsApp in the space of just a few months.Mr Gove said that “the more people who download the app the better” and was optimistic that people would decide to download it.“It’s striking how publicly spirited people have been throughout the crisis, and knowing that this is a contribution all of us can make to help keep our neighbours and our communities safer is a very powerful incentive, I think,” he said.On Sunday the government said 28,466 people are now known to have died due to coronavirus in the UK – a rise of 315 since Saturday.The figure puts the UK death toll higher than that of Spain, which has the greatest number of known cases of Covid-19 in Europe and just below Italy’s which is currently at 28,884.The UK is on course to become the worst affected country in Europe and the second-worst in the world, in terms of deaths, after the United States where 68,602 people have died. 
The White House is planning to roll out an executive order next week that aims to cut regulations, spur interstate pipeline construction and lower energy costs, according to two senior administration officials.The effort was spurred by the blockage of the construction of the 125-mile Constitution Pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York. A protracted legal battle over the project has been underway since the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, gave a greenlight in 2014 and 2016, because the state of New York has refused to issue a water permit.According to four current and former administration officials, the order directs the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to clarify Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, the law that gives states authority over permits where water quality is concerned.Backlash from states and governors is expected, especially in New York, where regulators warned of further legal action if FERC throws out its water safety review in the Constitution case.And Wall Street likely won’t see this as a big breakthrough.“We don’t think this manifestly changes the state of play,” said ClearView energy analyst Christine Tezak. “An executive order can’t change the statutory discretion of a state to approve, deny or waive, so a state could still say no.”But officials vow the administration’s broader goal is to lower energy prices by accelerating the transport of natural gas and to reaffirm U.S. energy “dominance,” a word that appeared multiple times in an early draft of the order.Energy executives are optimistic about the prospects for more pipeline construction.Dennis Xander, chief executive of West Virginia-based Denex Petroleum, said the state is at risk of a glut if it can’t ship more gas to New England or the Gulf states.“We now have more capacity than we do gas for the first time in several years,” Xander told CNBC. But in central West Virginia where Denex operates, “There’s no pipeline to get the gas transported.”Lower energy prices are of high interest to President Donald Trump, who has tweeted criticism of OPEC and its impact on higher prices at least 12 times.The executive order is currently slated to be signed on Wednesday, with Texas as one suggested location for the event. Administration officials caution the plans could change.
Gretchen Whitmer says heavily armed men and Confederate flags at state capitol ‘depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history’Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan issued a rebuke of the armed protesters who gathered inside the state capitol last week in defiance of statewide lockdown orders, saying the demonstrators embodied some of the “worst racism” of the nation’s history.“Some of the outrageousness of what happened at our capitol depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country,” Whitmer said during a Sunday interview on CNN’s State of the Union.Last week Donald Trump had said of the protesters: “These are very good people.”Hundreds of protesters, many not wearing protective face masks and some armed legally with “long guns”, gathered inside the statehouse in Lansing on Thursday as lawmakers debated the Democratic governor’s request to extend her emergency powers to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The tightly packed crowd attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists.Whitmer highlighted that the number of protesters was relatively small but that the imagery some of them used was a disturbing reminder of ugly elements of America’s past. “We know that people are not all happy about having to take the stay-home posture,” Whitmer said on Sunday, “and you know what, I’m not either. But we have to listen to the public health experts and displays like the one we saw in our state capitol are not representative of who we are in Michigan.“There were swastikas and Confederate flags and nooses and people with assault rifles. That’s a small group of people when you think that this is a state of almost 10 million people, the vast majority of whom are doing the right thing.”Displaying the Confederate flag, or other symbols of the slave-owning south during the American civil war, is usually seen as racist. While some claim they are celebrating southern identity, it is widely seen as a racist symbol deeply offensive to black Americans. There is also an ongoing campaign to remove Confederate war statues from public display or rename streets and buildings which commemorate Confederate generals or politicians.Last week, the Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who represents Michigan’s 13th congressional district, condemned the demonstrations at the state Capitol. “Black people get executed by police for just existing, while white people dressed like militia members carrying assault weapons are allowed to threaten State Legislators and staff,” Tlaib wrote in a tweet on Thursday.The protests continued to draw national attention on Friday when Trump once again threw his support behind the rightwing movement, saying Whitmer should “make a deal” with the demonstrators.“The governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,” the president wrote on Twitter. “These are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely! See them, talk to them, make a deal.”When asked if it was appropriate for the president to express support for protests in which “long guns” were carried on Friday afternoon, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said the president supported the right to protest within the law and while following federal social distancing guidelines.“The president says that we must protest lawfully and act within the bounds of the law,” said McEnany.The staggering effects of the pandemic among Whitmer’s electorate in terms of both illness and unemployment have placed a nationwide focus on Michigan, which is certain to be a key battleground state in the upcoming presidential election. The state had long been regarded as a Democratic stronghold but went for Trump four years ago, helping to spring his surprise electoral victory.
A new study from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School finds that Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s proposed wealth tax on the richest Americans will generate at least $1 trillion less than what the campaign claims, potentially undermining the key funding source for her plans to expand government-backed health care, education and other programs.Warren’s tax, if implemented in 2021, would raise $2.3 trillion to $2.7 trillion in additional revenue over 10 years, well below the $3.75 trillion her campaign estimates, according to the study viewed by CNBC.In other words, the study projects the proposed wealth tax will raise $1 trillion to $1.4 trillion less than the Warren campaign advertises.ADVERTISINGAds by Teads“That does mean — to the extent that they’re thinking about this money being used to pay for spending priorities and things like that — they will need to figure out how to come up with that difference,” Kent Smetters, faculty director for the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said in an interview with CNBC.In an email to CNBC, the Warren campaign staunchly defended the wealth tax and argued that the Wharton study relies on weak assumptions.“This analysis does not study Elizabeth’s actual plans -- it does not account for the strong anti-evasion measures in her wealth tax and does not even attempt to analyze the specific investments Elizabeth is committed to making with the wealth tax revenue,” said Saloni Sharma, the Warren campaign’s deputy press secretary.The Wharton report also said that the proposed tax would result in secondary economic impacts for families not directly subject to the duty.Its findings indicate average hourly wages in the economy, including those earned by households not directly subject to the wealth tax, are projected to fall 0.8% to 2.3% due to the reduction in private capital formation.It also says the tax would shrink the U.S. economy by 0.9% to 2.1% by 2050, depending on how Congress spends the revenues.“There’s a fundamental trade-off between how much money you raise and the impact it’s going to have on the economy,” Smetters said. “A wealth tax doesn’t just affect the billionaires: It has a broader impact on everybody because those billionaires are investing in companies that employ everybody.”“They’re not just employing other billionaires,” he added.Warren unveiled the latest iteration of her proposal last month, when the 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful announced a doubling of her billionaire tax from 3% to 6%. Warren’s wealth tax would also impose a 2% tax on net worth between $50 million and $1 billion and scale upward by wealth brackets until the final 6% rate.The campaign, which has relied on research from economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, estimated that doubling the highest rate would raise an additional $1 trillion over 10 years on top of her original wealth tax.All told, the combined figure could be north of $3.5 trillion over 10 years, according to the Warren campaign. But that’s well above what the Wharton study expects.Before including the tax’s macroeconomic effects on wages, hours worked and GDP growth, the university expects the tax to generate $2.7 trillion in real dollars. Accounting for such ripple effects yields the lower, $2.3 trillion projection.The Wharton figures, if correct, would represent a marked shortfall for the Warren campaign, which has billed its wealth tax as integral to its campaign ambitions for proposals like “Medicare for All” and reducing student loan debt.Critiques of the Wharton analysis could include its failure to consider the senator’s anti-evasion measures, designed to prevent households from reallocating cash to minimize or circumvent the tax.“This is an analysis of a different and worse plan than Elizabeth’s, using unsupportable assumptions about how the economy works, and its conclusions are meaningless,” Sharma said. Other experts and economists have found “that her middle-class investments will produce significant economic growth.”The Wharton authors acknowledge this in their study, noting that in the absence of specific legislative language, their evasion estimates are an educated guess based on the international record with wealth taxes.They also concede that the Warren campaign “stresses that significant enforcement efforts will be enacted as part of the policy,” including an acceleration in IRS audit rates.The study admits it doesn’t account for the types of investments that could be made using the wealth tax’s revenues when determining the growth effects of her plan.Should Congress use the revenue in a way that makes American corporations more productive (through fewer employee sick days or a better-educated labor force, for example), the adverse impact on economic growth would at least be lessened.
Monzo, the U.K. challenger bank with more than two million customers and a unicorn valuation to go with it, has formally announced its U.S. expansion.The tentative move — which TechCrunch exclusively reported was underway five months ago — will see a U.S. Monzo app and connected Mastercard debit card made available via in-person signups at events to be held soon. The rollout will initially consist of a few thousand cards, supported by a waitlist in preparation for a wider launch.In a call, Monzo  co-founder and CEO Tom Blomfield told me he thinks the key to cracking North America is to create a fully localised version of Monzo based on carefully listening to U.S. users in order to find market fit. There are obvious and less obvious cultural and technical differences in the way Brits and Americans save, spend and manage their finances, and this will require significant product divergence.In other words, Monzo isn’t presuming that specific features of the U.K. offering, which is currently seeing 200,000 people sign up each month, will automatically resonate with customers across the pond. To equally succeed in the U.S., it will be about the details, and in a sense the company will need to act like a startup within what is now a scale-up if it is to repeat much of the Monzo playbook.In the U.K., Monzo currently has an NPS score of 80, which Blomfield says is unusually high for a bank. He also tells me 60% of U.K. signups remain long-term active, transacting at once per week. However, as a counterpoint, the percentage of Monzo users that pay their salary into the Monzo account sits at between about 27% and 30% of active users, suggesting that a significant number of Monzo customers aren’t yet using it as their main account. Monzo’s definition of salaried is anyone who deposits at least £1,000 per month by bank transfer.Returning back to America, Monzo says it will develop the U.S. version into a “fully-featured digital account” that can be accessed on your smartphone and will have the ability to extend into various “Monzo and third-party financial services.”Initially, the challenger bank is partnering with an established U.S. bank, but is also working on applying for its own U.S. bank license. As in the U.K., the plan is to build and own as much of its technology stack as possible, which Blomfield says will be needed to give Monzo the agility to serve U.S. customers successfully.To achieve this, Monzo will open an office in Los Angeles, Calif., chosen “because it isn’t San Francisco,” says Blomfield. He says he was mindful of putting Monzo within the Silicon Valley bubble where rents are not only ridiculously high but product groupthink could be detrimental.Meanwhile, Monzo joins a growing list of London-based B2C fintechs hoping to conquer America. Earlier today, money management app Emma announced that it had launched in the U.S. via a partnership with Plaid. Another example is banking chatbot and app Cleo, which quietly entered the U.S. nine months ago.Added to this, Blomfield has always talked openly about his ambition to bring Monzo to the U.S. Over the years the challenger bank has attracted an array of U.S. investors. They include General Catalyst, Thrive Capital, Goodwater Capital, Stripe, Michael Moritz and Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom. Most recently, TechCrunch reported that Y Combinator is also set to join the company’s cap table.

Crude prices rose as much as 4%, a day after hitting five-month lows, after a suspected attack on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman near Iran and the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of global oil consumption passes.The S&P energy index jumped 1.21%, the most among the 11 major sectors. Shares of oil majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp rose 1% each.“There is a positive correlation between stock markets and oil prices which is the day’s catalyst,” Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.Wall Street’s main indexes have had a strong start to the month on hopes that the Federal Reserve will act to counter a slowing global economy due to the escalating trade war with China. The benchmark S&P 500 index has risen 5% so far in June.U.S. consumer prices data on Wednesday pointed to a moderate rise in inflation, adding to expectations of an interest rate cut as early as July. The Fed policymakers are set to meet on June 18-19 and markets have priced in at least three rate cuts in 2019.But on the trade front, there were doubts about any improvement in what President Donald Trump called “testy” trade relations with China in the run up to the G20 summit later in this month.“There is still uncertainty about trade policy and about what the Fed is going to do. That is still keeping a lot of people back on their heels at this point,” Brown said.Walt Disney Co shares rose 2.56%, pushing the communication services sector 0.80% higher, after Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for Disney Plus subscriber growth.At 9:53 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 109.90 points, or 0.42%, at 26,114.73, the S&P 500 was up 13.06 points, or 0.45%, at 2,892.90 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.41 points, or 0.66%, at 7,844.13.Offering the biggest boost to the indexes were gains in marquee companies Facebook Inc, Apple Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc, which rose between 0.5% and 1.1%.Tyson Foods rose 1.51% after the meat processor launched its first vegan and mixed protein products. Shares of vegan burger maker Beyond Meat dropped 1.65%.Twitter Inc shares fell 3.26%, the most among S&P 500 companies, after brokerage Moffett Nathanson said it expects the social media company’s costs to rise and revenue growth to slow.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3.87-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 2.48-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 32 new highs and 24 new lows.

Italy, one of the worst-hit countries in the pandemic, has been under a nationwide lockdown since March 9. More than 210,000 people in the European country have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and nearly 29,000 have died, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.Italy reported some 1,400 new cases on Sunday, down from its peak of around 6,600 new cases on March 21.
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Tourists from the cruise ship that was near the volcanic island in New Zealand when it erupted arrived in Wellington on Thursday, many traumatized by the deaths of co-passengers and others recalling their brush with tragedy.Royal Caribbean’s 16-deck cruise liner, Ovation of the Seas, was docked at Tauranga port on the Bay of Plenty, about 100 km (60 miles) from the volcanic White Island when it erupted suddenly on Monday.Many tourists from the cruise had booked tours to see the volcano and were on the uninhabited island when it started spewing steam and gas, with ash plumes shooting 12,000 feet (3,658 m) into the air.At least eight people were killed and over two dozen have serious burns. Another eight people are missing and presumed dead, buried under the ash on the island.It was not clear how many of them were from Ovation of the Seas. Australian John Bartley, one of the passengers, said he was told by staff on the cruise that two crew members and one passenger died in the eruption, while about 23 were injured.Calls and emails to Royal Caribbean were not immediately returned. It said previously that passengers from its cruise were on the island at the time and it grieved “this tragic loss”, but gave no further details.“The mood was pretty sad,” said Bartley, 52, a native of Sydney who was on the cruise with his family.“We feel so bad for these people. You don’t expect to go on a holiday and not return. We are very adventurous too and we would have definitely gone on that volcano tour. But we had a friend with kids so we decided not to,” he said.He and other passengers were in Wellington on Thursday where the cruise ship docked after being stranded in Tauranga for two days. They were brought to the downtown area where many visited restaurants, shopped or just sat around in the park enjoying a sunny morning.Many declined comment, saying the experience was too traumatic.“A family just 10 rooms past us are still in the hospital,” said Jim Karamanov from Adelaide, Australia, who was on the tour with his wife Suzanne.“We saw some police officers come around to pick up their things from the room. It was quite devastating,” he said.He said after the news of the tragedy, many passengers just spent their time huddled in rooms or on the deck checking the news on their phones.“It’s put a dampener on everything. You feel ill,” said his wife, Suzanne.The 12-day cruises that leave from Sydney visit New Zealand’s famed sounds, or fjords, lakes and volcanoes, according to Royal Caribbean’s web site. The ship has over 2,000 staterooms and can carry nearly 5,000 passengers and 1,500 crew.WHO IS RESPONSIBLE?Some passengers questioned who was to blame for the incident, and said they were unaware of the risks of going on the volcano tour.“A whole lot of things went wrong that day,” said Scott, an Australian national, who did not want to give his full name. He was on the cruise with his friend Dave and said he had thought of taking the volcano tour but backed out.“No one knew there was a threat on the island. Local authorities should have taken responsibility of informing tourists,” he said.The government has launched an inquiry into the incident.“Everything will change about tourism in New Zealand after this. I think, even insurance will not cover these volcano tours anymore. The risks seem so high,” he said.Ovation of the Seas said in a statement to Reuters earlier this week that it was working with local authorities, and providing all the help and care it can to the guests and their families, including offering medical resources and counseling.
When it comes to money managing, three is better than one.“Teams do better than single-managed funds,” Michael Mauboussin, director of research at BlueMountain Capital Management, said at the Project Punch Card Conference in New York City on Wednesday. “The best team size is three. The next best is five.”Funds managed by three-person teams tend to outperform solo-run funds by 58 basis points a year, beating any other team size, according to Mauboussin. Although the effect is small, it’s statistically significant that teams are better at managing money, he noted.ADVERTISINGAds by TeadsIn the mutual fund universe, those listing a single manager are hard to come by these days. Seventy-five percent of all actively managed funds are team managed, and only 25% are run by a single manager, according to a recent Morningstar study.In 1992, 67% of U.S. stock funds were run by a single manager, according to Morningstar data. Back in the day, many funds were built around legendary investing personalities like Peter Lynch, who managed Fidelity’s Magellan Fund and John Neff, who ran the Vanguard Windsor Fund.Figuring out the appropriate size for a team is crucial, Mauboussin said. It’s inevitably less productive when the team gets too big due to reduced motivation and elevated costs of coordination, he noted.“The idea that more people tend to be better — more experience, more training, different points of view, and that’s to a large degree offset by coordination costs — getting people physically together,” Mauboussin said. “Smaller is better than bigger. Three would be preferable than seven.”Furthermore, people should go beyond the typical social category diversity when creating a team, Mauboussin said. Social category diversity reflects differences in race, ethnicity, gender, age, etc. Cognitive diversity includes differences in education, training, experience, expertise and personality, which is key to problem-solving, Mauboussin said.Before joining BlueMountain, Mauboussin was head of global financial strategies at Credit Suisse and chief investment strategist at Legg Mason Capital Management. Mauboussin has been an adjunct professor of finance at Columbia Business School since 1993.
President Donald Trump is not expected to impose new tariffs on China this weekend, but he may not have much of a trade deal to show either.That promise, however, should be enough to satisfy the stock market, which was soaring after the president tweeted that he expects a “very big” deal with China and both sides want it. The S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq were trading at all-time highs Thursday but gave up some of their early morning gains.Sources told CNBC that the Trump administration had reached an agreement in principle on a phase one trade deal. The sources said the U.S. negotiators offered to cancel the new tariffs that would take effect Sunday and were also willing to cut existing tariffs by up to 50% on $360 billion of Chinese goods. A rollback on the existing tariffs was considered to be an important and potentially deal-breaking request from China.Trump set a Dec. 15 deadline on a new batch of tariffs on $156 billion in Chinese goods, which targeted many consumer products, such as cell phones, laptops and toys.“This is the president helping the Santa Claus rally even more,” said Prudential Financial chief market strategist Quincy Krosby. “This is as much of a signal as we’ve wanted.”Krosby added that while there have been plenty of headlines on trade, Trump has been relatively quiet lately and this declaration in a tweet was particularly meaningful ahead of the deadline, since it came directly from him and he says both sides want a deal. It is also a big contrast to Trump’s Dec. 3 comment that he could wait until after the election for a deal, which sent the Dow skidding more than 450 points.Trump met with his advisors at the White House on Thursday, as the weekend deadline approached.“The devil is in the details. If you just look at his sound bites on Oct. 11, they’re identical to what he just said. The chances of more tariffs on the 15th are slim,” said Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments. “I think they’ll find some way to finesse that. In terms of some big sweeping deal, it’s either a wimpy deal or no deal.”Trump on Oct. 11 said “good things” are happening with negotiations, but that was two months ago and since then there has not been much in the way of signs of concrete progress.“One thing you can be sure of is [Trump] will spin this as a great victory. To be fair, he’s had a hell of a week. He’s going to be acquitted in the Senate. He got a defense bill with family leave for federal workers and apparently the USMCA,” Valliere said, noting that the trade agreement with Canada and Mexico could take awhile to get through the Senate. “If we avoid tariffs on the 15th, it’s a plus for the markets.”The base case for many Wall Street firms has been that the tariffs would not be implemented Sunday, and there would either be a phase one deal, focused on China buying U.S. agricultural products, or at least a commitment to an agreement in the near future. The tougher parts of the negotiations are expected to resume next year, on such issues as intellectual property and technology transfers.Ethan Harris, Bank of America Merrill Lynch global head of economics, said recently that he expected a deal but it couldn’t be ruled out completely that the U.S. would walk away if negotiations failed. “With markets seemingly pricing a very high probability of a deal, ‘no deal’ could be very disruptive,” he wrote. But he does expect a deal that would build on concessions that have already been offered.“Most important, it likely includes an increase in agricultural imports by China and an indefinite delay of the October and December tariffs. Beyond this there is greater uncertainty,” he noted. “Our base case is that China makes modest compromises on financial-sector access, intellectual-property protection and FX transparency. In return, we think the US removes the ‘manipulator’ label and extends waivers for US companies to sell inputs to Huawei.”Harris put low odds on a comprehensive deal. “The US-China conflict is much broader than the trade war. It is a struggle between the world’s leading superpowers, and between fundamentally different economic models,” he noted. “There are many flash points in this struggle. The most important and hardest to resolve is the tech war, which combines concerns about fairness in trade, long-run economic growth and national security.”Goldman Sachs economists also expect a deal in which the U.S. would delay or scrap the December tariffs and roll back Sept. 1 tariffs of about $100 billion in return for China buying agricultural products and other concessions.“Under this baseline scenario, we expect the trade war drag on growth to fade by the end of 2020,” they wrote. “However, if the escalation continued and the December tariffs were to go into effect, the trade drag on sequential 2020 growth would be 0.4pp larger than in our baseline.”
Updated: ABC News World News Tonight anchor David Muir landed an interview with Donald Trump during his trip to Arizona on Tuesday, and one of the bigger pieces of news out of the conversation was the president’s acknowledgement that there may be some fatal tradeoffs as states reopen their economies.Asked if lives will be lost in the desire to ease stay at home orders and other social distancing restrictions, Trump said, “It’s possible there will be some because you won’t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is. But at the same time, we’re going to practice social distancing.He added, “We’re going to be washing hands. We’re going to be doing a lot of the things that we’ve learned to do over the last period of time. And we have to get our country back. When you look at suicides. Take a look at what is going on. People are losing their jobs. We have to bring it back, and that is what we are doing.”Trump said that some people will be affected by decisions to reopen the economy in some states, as governors grapple with historic levels of unemployment.“Will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon,” Trump said.The interview was a relatively rare instance when Trump sat down with a non-Fox network, as the president has favored the news channel and its rightward opinion hosts. But Muir took some criticism for not challenging Trump on a number of key points, including the president’s insistence that Americans will have access to testing when the country reopens.Muir, who also serves as managing editor of the newscast, did ask Trump about his frequent blaming of his predecessor, Barack Obama, for leaving an insufficient national stockpile of emergency supplies. The president has said that “the cupboard was bare,” even though that claim has been deemed “mostly false” by Politifact.Bret Baier On Co-Anchoring Donald Trump’s Next Town Hall, The President’s Media Bashing And Scrutiny Of Fox News Coronavirus Coverage — The Deadline Q&amp;AEven so, Muir queried the president on why his administration didn’t replenish it in the three years he has been in office.“Well, to be honest, I have a lot things going on,” Trump said. “We had a lot of people that refused to allow the country to be successful. They wasted a lot of time on Russia, Russia, Russia that turned out to be a total hoax. And then they did Ukraine, Ukraine, and that was a total hoax. Then they impeached the president of the United States for absolutely no reason.”Still, Trump’s claim that he inherited “broken tests” from Obama also went unchallenged. The president has made that claim before at coronavirus press briefings, but it is not entirely clear what he means, as the coronavirus had yet to exist when Obama was in office, making it impossible to create a test for it.CNN’s fact checker Daniel Dale wrote on Twitter, “A thing about Trump is that he tells the same lies over and over. I have no expectations for ‘interviewers’ from Fox, but it’s not that hard for others who get to talk to him to come prepared and willing to respond with facts.”Muir did bring up Trump’s claim, at the end of February, when he suggested that the number of coronavirus cases would go down to zero. Trump said then, “When you have 15 people and when the 15 within a couple of days is going to go down to zero. That’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”Trump responded, “You would say, worse than that I said one person, one time. And it’s true. There was a time when we had one person in this country. We knew about it. We worked on it. But we have one person, it mushroomed, the 15 people, mushroomed. Other people were coming in, also from Europe. Don’t forget.”Muir repsponded, “But we’re at more than a million cases now.”Trump said, “But don’t forget, in January — Okay, let’s talk about cases. You know why we’re at a million cases? Because we have more testing than anybody else. If we tested as much as these countries down here, okay, who don’t do very much testing at all. Look at Japan: very little testing. They’re at the bottom of the rung.”Earlier on Tuesday, Vice President Pence confirmed plans to disband the White House coronavirus task force by the end of the month, even though many health experts believe that the crisis won’t really end until  a vaccine is produced. One model showed that there could be as many as 135,000 deaths by August.“There’ll be more death, that the virus will pass, with or without a vaccine,” Trump told Muir. “And I think we’re doing very well on the vaccines but, with or without a vaccine, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be back to normal. But it’s been a rough process. There is no question about it.”According to Johns Hopkins University, there have been 71,031 deaths from coronavirus in the U.S. and 1,203,673 confirmed cases.The rest of the interview aired on Nightline and on Good Morning America on Wednesday.The full transcript is here. 
Tom Cruise is in talks with Nasa about working on a movie shot in outer space, according to the head of the space agency.“Nasa is excited to work with Tom Cruise on a film aboard the Space Station!,” Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine wrote on Twitter.“We need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists to make Nasa’s ambitious plans a reality.”Bridenstine gave no further details but the tweet followed a report in Hollywood trade outlet Deadline that Cruise was working with Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur Elon Musk to make what would be the first feature film to be shot in space.Musk has not officially confirmed the collaboration, but replied to Bridenstine, “Should be a lot of fun!”The proposed action adventure is in its early stages, Deadline reported on Monday.Representatives for Cruise did not immediately return a request for comment.Mission: Impossible star Tom Cruise, 57, is renowned for his daredevil films and for doing his own stunts. He flew fighter jets for the upcoming Top Gun: Maverick, and for the Mission Impossible films has hung off the side of a plane as it took off, and climbed the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai – the tallest building in the world.Filming on Mission: Impossible 7 was put on hold in February as the coronavirus epidemic took hold of Italy. The disease has led to a worldwide shutdown of Hollywood movie and TV production and the closure of movie theatres. 
China has successfully launched a new rocket and prototype spacecraft, according to state media, in a major test of its ambitions to operate a permanent space station and send astronauts to the Moon.A Long March 5B rocket took off from the Wenchang launch site on the southern island of Hainan and eight minutes later an unmanned prototype spacecraft successfully separated and entered its planned orbit, Xinhua reported. A test version of a cargo return capsule also successfully separated from the rocket, Xinhua said.China hopes that the craft will one day transport astronauts to a space station that it plans to complete by 2022 – and eventually to the Moon. It will have capacity for a crew of six.The spacecraft and capsule were slated to return to a landing site by Friday after completing their test flights, said Ji Qiming of China’s manned space agency.The United States is so far the only country to have sent humans to the Moon. But in its effort to catch up China has sent astronauts into space, satellites into orbit and a rover to the far side of the Moon in 2019.The successful maiden flight of the 54-metre Long March 5B – which has a takeoff mass of about 849 tonnes – should reassure China, following failures of the 7A model in March and 3B model in April. Beijing has launched several spacecraft since 1999 and its previous vessel, the Shenzhou, was modelled after Russia’s Soyuz.Assembly of the Tiangong space station, whose name means Heavenly Palace, is expected to begin this year and finish in 2022. It will have three modules, with living and working quarters and two annexes for scientific experiments.China plans to send an astronaut to the Moon in about a decade and then build a base there. Its lunar rover on the far side has driven about 450 metres so far.The next big mission for Beijing is to land a probe on Mars, with liftoff expected this year.  
Mobile operator O2 may be set to merge with broadband giant Virgin Media to create one of the country's largest entertainment and telecoms firms.A tie-up between two big players in Britain's telecoms and media sector would create a major rival to BT.Spanish firm Telefonica, which owns O2, confirmed that it was in talks with Virgin-owner Liberty Global.The company stressed that the negotiations were ongoing and there was no guarantee they would reach a deal."The process initiated by both parties is in a negotiation phase, not being able to guarantee, to this date, neither the precise terms nor the probability of its success," Telefonica said.Virgin Media declined to comment.O2, which provides the network for Tesco Mobile, Giffgaff and Sky Mobile, is the UK's largest phone company with around 34 million users.Virgin has about six million broadband and cable TV customers and another three million mobile users.A tie-up between the two would increase pressure on BT, which owns the UK's second-largest mobile network EE.BT has 28 million mobile, TV and broadband customers across the country. It also provides services to a million businesses.Telefonica tried to sell O2 to the owner of Three, CK Hutchison, for £10.3bn in 2015. However, that deal was blocked by the European Commission over concerns that it would have left just three major mobile phone operators in the UK.But telecoms analyst Paolo Pescatore, who works for PP Foresight, does not think a deal between O2 and Virgin would face similar hurdles.He said Virgin Media mainly provided services through cable, such as broadband and TV, whereas O2 focuses on mobile."It's very much complementary," he said.Describing what a tie-up between the two companies could look like, Mr Pescatore said: "If you're an O2 customer, you'll be able to buy more than just mobile."If you're a Virgin Media customer, the vision - ultimately - will be that you can buy everything in one place with one bill, which isn't the case today."But fellow telecoms analyst Kester Mann, who works at CCS Insight, said customers may need a "new mind-set" if packages for mobile, TV and broadband are to gain popularity."The UK has been a very slow market compared to others in Europe to transition towards this idea of packaged and bundled services," he said. "Customers haven't been demanding these types or services."However, companies like them. "If they can lock customers in to fixed line and mobile then obviously it's that much harder to extract yourself from," Mr Mann said. 
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Thursday said her country’s military justice system needed to be given the chance to work and asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to drop the genocide case against it.“Myanmar requests the court to remove the case from its list”, Suu Kyi said on the third and final day of hearings in The Hague.The ICJ said it would render an order “as soon as possible”, but gave no specific date.
Lord Alan Sugar, 73, has hit out at Piers Morgan after the GMB host shared on Twitter that he was tested for coronavirus as he is an essential key worker.Piers, 55, was concerned that he had contracted the deadly bug after coming down with symptoms but he has tested negative for Covid-19 and is soon set to return to his job hosting morning show Good Morning Britain.Government guidelines state that essential key workers such as front line health workers and social care staff - including journalists and broadcasters who are providing public service broadcasting - are entitled to be tested at test points.After Piers announced that he has the all-clear and that he was "entitled" to a test as he is an "essential key worker" Lord Sugar hit out at the controversial presenter for not being an essential worker and branded him a "hypocrite" who has "deprived" others of being able to be tested.The Apprentice star pointed out that he was happy to hear that Piers did not have the deadly bug but shared that another presenter could step in for Piers if he was unwell and that he is "certainly not essential."Following Piers' tweet announcing about being tested and healthy, Lord Sugar re-tweeted the message and asked why the outspoken ITV face was classed as essential.The tweet read: "RT @piersmorgan My COVID-19 test was negative. I was entitled to do so as a Govt-designated essential worker. I'll be back on @GMB as soon as my doctor advises I'm OK to return to work. SINCERELY PLEASED TO HEAR YOU ARE NEGATIVE. HOWEVER WHY ARE YOU A GOVT ESSENTIAL WORKER ?"Alan then micro-blogged again as he lashed out: "Have I missed something ? Like the Govn "Masochist bill". According to @piersmorgan he is a Govn- designated essential worker. Does he mean the Govn see him essential to sl*g them off every day. There are other presenters to step in @gmb he is certainly not essential."Continuing to fume and musing at how Piers would act if the shoe was on the other foot, Alan then tweeted again: ". @piersmorgan not an Govn-designated essential worker. There're Nurses, Doctors, Police, Army,train and truck drivers."He deprived a real essential workers from a test.If this was Hugh Grant, Meghan or other of his enemies like me."He would be howling from the rooftops. HYPOCRITE"Lord Sugar then told his 5.3 million followers: "Frankly @piersmorgan has shot himself in the foot. He would have done better saying nothing and not mention testing. He has opened a can of worms for people to have a go at him. However good news he tested negative."On Sunday former newspaper editor Piers told fans he'd have to take a step back from GMB after suffering mild Covid-19 symptoms and was awaiting the result of a test.He tweeted: "UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs..."I've had a test for COVID-19 and so won’t be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow."Piers didn't go into what symptoms he had experienced, but did reveal he was going by medical advice.Yesterday he then announced that his results were negative and that he soon will be returning to work.During Piers' time off TV presenter Ben Shepard stood in for him and anchored the ITV news show with Susanna Ried. 
Britain has the worst coronavirus death toll in Europe, official figures showed on Tuesday, prompting calls for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic.The government’s tally of fatalities across the UK reached 29,427 for those who tested positive for coronavirus, exceeding the 29,029 recorded in Italy – until now Europe’s worst-hit country. Italy’s total does not include suspected cases.Newly released data from the Office for National Statistics showed that 29,648 deaths were registered in England and Wales with Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate by 2 May. With the addition of the official death figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland, this was calculated to take the UK’s toll to 32,313.The true figure is likely to be significantly higher due to missed cases and a lag in reporting.While experts such as Prof David Spiegelhalter, chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge University and a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), have warned of the risks of comparing countries’ death tolls, he said on Tuesday: “We are not doing very well and it’s been another very bad week. I really don’t like this league table of who’s top and who’s not, but there’s no denying that these are really serious numbers.”Dr Claudia Paoloni, president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association trade union, said Britain having the highest number of deaths in Europe showed that ministers had “searching questions” to answer about their “inadequate” handling of the crisis, and called for a public inquiry.“This is a very sobering and unwelcome milestone. It’s of extreme concern that the UK now has the largest number of Covid deaths in Europe,” she said. “There will have to be a full investigation of the [government’s] handling of the Covid response in due course – a public inquiry – to understand why we are experiencing such large numbers in comparison to the rest of Europe.“It puts into question whether the government’s tactics at the start of the pandemic were sufficiently fast, and especially whether the lockdown should have happened earlier and whether we should have been better prepared with increased capacity for viral testing and contact tracing from the start. Both have proven inadequate.”Dr Chaand Nagpaul, British Medical Association council chair, said the figures were extremely concerning “given that the UK was originally affected by the outbreak later than many other nations, and with the government initially saying that a death toll of 20,000 would be a ‘good outcome’.”“It’s too early to come to firm conclusions and we need to ensure that figures between nations are comparing like for like,” he said. “However, there will in the future need to be serious scrutiny of the UK’s response and questions asked about what measures were put in when, from imposition of lockdown to our approach to testing, and whether this may have contributed to the loss of more lives.”The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “Today’s confirmation we have the highest official death rate in Europe is a tragic reminder of the severity of this horrific disease. The public will rightly ask why our death rate is so high.”Speaking at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, the first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, repeated previous warnings by ministers and experts against making international comparisons, describing it as “speculation” to say the UK had the highest death toll in Europe.“I don’t think we’ll get a real verdict on how well countries have done until the pandemic is over and particularly until we’ve got comprehensive international data on all cause of mortality,” he said.“We now publish data that includes all deaths in all settings and not all countries do that so I’m not sure that the international comparison works unless you reliably know that all countries are measuring in the same way.” Italy quickly became a centre of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, with the first deaths coming in late February, and it was the first European country to move into lockdown.As the death toll rose, so did the number of theories about what went wrong. Italy’s large ageing population, culture of close social interactions and densely populated cities, as well as a lack of time to prepare and a slow initial response to the virus were among the reasons cited as why the country was so badly hit.The UK, it was said, should learn from Italy. Now, it seems it could be at least as badly struck.The latest ONS figures show that 21,997 people died from all causes in the week ending 24 April, which is 11,539 more than the average for that week.That total was 354 fewer than the record level of 22,351 the week before, however. This was the first decrease in weekly deaths since the start of the outbreak and supports other figures showing that the UK is past the peak of coronavirus infections.The increase in Covid-19 deaths only partly explains the unprecedented levels in total deaths. The reasons behind an extra 3,312 deaths in the week ending 24 April remain unclear, with speculation that they could have been caused by delayed hospital admissions for other life-threatening conditions and other factors such as economic hardship, and mental health problems.Spiegelhalter said: “Well over 3,000 [of the excess deaths] weren’t labelled as Covid. So nearly a third were from something else. There is a continuing anxiety that many of these are due to the lockdown itself.“The one thing we do know is that the health service has been hugely disrupted, not just in terms of routine care, cancelled chemotherapies and radio therapies and elective surgeries, but also of people with symptoms not going to hospital.”Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, called for an urgent review into deaths caused indirectly by the virus. “We urgently need to identify the cause of these deaths. There are many plausible theories as to their cause, however, we need real data on this urgently,” he said. “As we go forward, we want to minimise all deaths, not just those tagged as Covid-19.”The latest figures also show that total care home deaths were 595 higher than the week before, at 7,911, whereas hospital deaths were 1,191 lower, at 8,243.Of the coronavirus deaths registered up to 1 May in England and Wales, 6,686 took place in care homes, which was 22.5% of all the deaths from the virus at that point, the ONS figures show.Provisional charts shared with journalists by Spiegelhalter showed coronavirus deaths in care homes now exceeding deaths in hospitals. He said: “I can be pretty confident that these [lines representing deaths in care homes and hospitals] have actually crossed a week or so ago with more Covid deaths happening out of hospital than in hospital.” He added that it was too early to tell whether deaths in care homes had peaked.For the first time last week, the government began including data on deaths outside hospitals in cases where people had tested positive for coronavirus, in the daily death toll figures for the virus. By contrast the ONS figures include all deaths where Covid-19 is mentioned on death certificates. 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump reprised his ridicule of 16-year-old Greta Thunberg on Thursday after the Swedish climate activist was named Time’s Person of the Year for 2019.Thunberg won the magazine’s annual honorific on Wednesday for her work inspiring millions of young people to take action against climate change.“So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!” Trump, 73, wrote on Twitter, commenting on another person’s tweet congratulating Thunberg.Thunberg responded by updating her Twitter biography to include: “A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old-fashioned movie with a friend.”The spat, which propelled Thunberg to trend on Twitter with several hashtags, came on the fourth anniversary of the Paris climate pact that Trump withdrew from soon after taking office.It was not the first time the Republican president targeted Thunberg.In September, Trump retweeted a clip of the teenager’s speech to a United Nations climate summit in which she angrily denounced world leaders for failing to tackle climate change by demanding: “How dare you?”His sarcastic commentary: “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!”Thunberg also changed her Twitter biography following that slight to describe herself as “A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.”Thunberg had also been a contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, an honor Trump covets.Trump himself received the Time magazine designation in 2016 after he won the U.S. presidential election over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
At only 18 years old, “Never Have I Ever” star Maitreyi Ramakrishnan is soon to become a household name, but the Canadian teen isn’t letting any of the early success of the show go to her head.“I think I’ll always just be a girl from Mississauga,” Ramakrishnan said on the Variety After Show, presented by National Geographic, when asked if she feels like a ‘superstar’ after the show shot to No. 1 on Netflix. “No matter what, I think that’ll always be my roots.”Ramakrishnan is currently quarantining at home with her family in Canada instead of walking the red carpet in New York or Los Angeles to celebrate the coming-of-age comedy from co-creators Mindy Kaling and Lang Fisher. But the young star is still relishing in the excitement around the new show, which centers around Ramakrishnan’s character Devi Vishwakumar, an Indian American teen growing up in Southern California. Devi is a nerdy, hot-headed overachiever who desperately wants to be cool. And in addition to the ultra-relatable high school drama about fitting in, searching for love and trying to figure out who you are, Devi is also dealing with the sudden death of her father.“It’s awesome because I’m seeing so many people saying, ‘Oh my God, I can relate to this so much.’ Whether it’s something as simple as one of the arm hair jokes — because let’s be real, even though I’m 100% confident with my arm hair, there are days where I go up to my father and I say, ‘Why did you do this to me? Why can’t you give me anything else?’” Ramakrishnan says. “Or somebody saying, ‘Thank you, this made me really realize I have some unpacking to do with the loss of a family member’…That’s all I wanted from this show. Emmys for the cast, Emmys for the direction, a Nobel Peace Prize — I’m not opposed — but, in all seriousness, this is all I wanted from the show.”It’s been a whirlwind since Ramakrishnan’s first audition (recorded with her best friend at her local community center) and beating out 15,000 other actors on her way to becoming the breakout star in Kaling and Fisher’s show: “This is my first job ever. I never had a job before this. Mindy is my first boss.”“Honestly, I don’t think on set I ever felt like the star because my drama teacher always taught me if you’re a star [or] if you’re the lead of the show, that means s—. You do not matter that much. You are just the same as everyone else,” she recalls. “That was my mindset coming to set, I didn’t think I was anything crazy special. One thing I won’t forget is just having everybody be so kind to teach me everything that I asked. I asked so many questions. I wanted to learn everything — between hair and makeup to lighting and sound. My fellow actors, I love them so much because they’re the ones that gave me the confidence to do the performance I did. I couldn’t have done that just purely out of high school. A part of that process was my cast members being such great homies to me and supporting me.”Since “Never Have I Ever” debuted on April 27, Ramakrishnan has been inundated with messages from fans who have fallen in love with the series and its diverse representation, especially given the fact that her character leads the series as a South Asian young woman.“For a lot of people of color and the South Asian community — I can speak for myself here when I say that we’re so used to being sidekicks, we’re so used to being comedic relief,” she explains. “And sure, there’s nothing wrong with being a sidekick or being funny or the comedic relief … but it isn’t okay when it’s offensive and when that’s all you get. Suddenly, all you’re doing is you’re seeing yourself as a sidekick, as not as important. And when you do relate to a character, they’re usually Caucasian and then you realize you’re living your life in the shadows as a person of color and you’re only able to see yourself through white characters, which is not totally okay either.”The show also promotes cultural sensitivity, which is especially important to the young Tamil Canadian actor. “That active effort for Devi’s name ‘Vishwakumar,’ to get that right, it’s important because that’s her name. You deserve to be called the way you want to be called, no matter what.”“Obviously Tamil names are super long. My entire full name — Maitreyi Ramakrishnan — I have 20 letters, but I do have my friends at school that just call me Ramakrishnan and they pronounce it correctly. I think names are so important,” she explains. “I think one of the greatest disrespects you can do to a person is not put the effort into somebody’s name. Personally for me, I used to anglicize my name … in high school. And then when I landed in L.A., they were like, ‘How do you say your name? Sorry, I don’t want to mix it up.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh my God, this is my chance to reclaim my name’ because I love my name. Why would I change it?”As for the status of a second season of the breakout hit, Ramakrishnan says she doesn’t know anything just yet, but she has dreams for Devi’s future.“Three main things — understanding that she needs to be more appreciative of her family and her friends because her friends do a lot for her. Her friends really are her day ones. And also understanding where her mother’s coming from. That is something that we’ll be able to have a lot of audiences relate to, understanding where our parents are coming from even though they might not go about doing certain things the best way possible,” she says.“Then also the idea of approaching that grief — confronting it, having that battle, even though it’s something uncomfortable to think about, [but] actually just running toward it and facing it, dealing with it head on,” she continues. “And then number three, of course, embracing her culture because that is so important in a world where identity is everything. It’s how you portray yourself. It’s how you show yourself to the world and how everybody will view you, but also how you accept yourself. And I think if Devi does those magic three, she might be a little bit more at peace with herself.”“Never Have I Ever” is streaming on Netflix. 
When alarmed health care workers sent samples of what appeared to be a new virus to China’s “batwoman” for urgent testing late last year, the renowned virologist admitted she was skeptical.“Drop whatever you are doing and deal with it now,” health authorities told Shi Zhengli, an expert on coronaviruses in bats at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.“I wondered if [the municipal health authority] got it wrong,” said the scientist. “I had never expected this kind of thing to happen in Wuhan, in central China.”For years, the bats Shi had studied in her field work were plucked from caves in China’s fetid, subtropical regions in the south, not in the colder parts of the country, she told she told Scientific American in an interview first published in March.But health officials were very worried about the samples they sent on Dec. 30, 2019, to her lab. They showed a new coronavirus that had led to atypical pneumonia in two Wuhan patients.By the time she started analyzing the samples, the new coronavirus was spreading rapidly in China. Months later, COVID-19 would become a global pandemic, leading to more than 3.3 million cases and resulting in 240,000 deaths, according to the most recent statistics compiled by Johns Hopkins University.Now, the same lab where Shi works at the pandemic’s ground zero in Wuhan is at the center of a recently leaked bombshell intelligence dossier that accuses the Chinese government of gross cover-ups about the human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus, and says authorities lied about the virus’ rapid spread and suppressed information that could help scientists develop a vaccine. Beijing also locked up whistle-blowing doctors who first reported on the new virus, and bleached stalls at outdoor markets in Wuhan where the coronavirus was said to have originated.The 15-page dossier prepared by the “Five Eyes” alliance, an intelligence-sharing coalition of the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, also suggests that the coronavirus could have escaped from Shi’s lab. The intelligence report, which was recently leaked to the Australian Daily Telegraph, cites a lack of security protocols at the Wuhan lab that could have caused the virus to escape to the outside world.Weeks after she began analyzing the virus, scientists around the world began pointing to the Wuhan lab.“I promise with my life that the virus has nothing to do with the lab,” Shi said in a statement on Feb. 2.But a month later, in March, Shi admitted she’d endured several sleepless nights. “Could they have come from our lab?” she asked, according to Scientific American, referring to the coronavirus.Last week, rumors swirled on social media that Shi had defected from China taking years of confidential research on bat coronaviruses with her to the US Embassy in Paris. She quickly denied the rumors on WeChat, a Chinese messaging service, and posted nine pictures of herself in Wuhan on Saturday.“No matter how difficult things are, it [defecting] shall never happen,” she said. “We’ve done nothing wrong. With a strong belief in science, we will see the day when the clouds disperse and the sun shines.”Since 2004, Shi has been studying viruses in bats in southern China. The research began in order to understand the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS, the first major epidemic of the 21st century, which began spreading in 2002.Her breakthrough came in 2013, when she collected a sample of bat feces from a cave in Yunnan province which was found to contain a virus that was 96.2 percent identical to SARS CoV-2, the virus that caused COVID-19. Shi’s team then worked to alter parts of the coronavirus in order to analyze whether they could be transmitted from one species to another. Two years later, in 2015, in research conducted in conjunction with the University of North Carolina, Shi’s lab reached the conclusion that the SARS-like virus could jump from bats to humans and that there was no known treatment.“This virus is highly pathogenic and treatments developed against the original SARS virus in 2002 and the ZMapp drugs used to fight Ebola fail to neutralize and control this particular virus,” said Ralph Baric, a co-author on the 2015 study from the University of North Carolina in an interview with Science Daily.For years, US diplomats and scientists who visited the Wuhan lab warned the US administration about a lack of safety protocols among scientists studying deadly pathogens. The lab, which is affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, stores more than 1,500 strains of deadly viruses.“During interactions with scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of ­appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,” according to a Jan. 19, 2018, diplomatic cable obtained by The Washington Post.The US intelligence community has long worried about the same thing. Last Thursday, President Trump told a news conference that he had seen evidence linking the coronavirus to a lab in Wuhan after US intelligence officials confirmed that they were looking into “whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.”Despite intelligence probes into whether her laboratory may have been responsible for the outbreak, Dr. Shi is forging ahead with her research, which she argues is more important than ever in preventing a  new pandemic. She said she plans to head a national project to systemically sample viruses in bat caves. She estimated that there are more than 5000 coronavirus strains “waiting to be discovered in bats globally.”“Bat-borne coronaviruses will cause more outbreaks,” she told Scientific American. “We must find them before they find us.”
Michael Jordan's Air Jordan sneaker series is probably the most iconic shoe line in history. Since their release in 1984, Nike has released a new edition nearly every year. The shoes have long transcended basketball, leaving an indelible impact on the fashion and music world. Nike was able to ink Jordan to a five-year deal worth $500,000 per year, with the opportunity to earn more in stock options and other bonuses.Were it up to a 21-year-old Jordan in 1984, however, he never would have signed with Nike. His preferred choice? One of Nike's main rival companies: Adidas."Do you have a shoe company that you wanted to go with?" Jordan is asked during episode five of The Last Dance documentary. "That was Adidas," he replies.In archival footage from Jordan before his NBA career began, Jordan is seen saying "I like the Lakers, I like Marques Johnson, and I like Adidas. I like Adidas shoes.”During this segment of the episode, Adidas is portrayed as being disorganized, and unable to support the creation of a signature basketball shoe at the time Jordan was entering the league."Adidas was really dysfunctional by that time," says Jordan's agent, David Falk. "And they had just told me, ‘Look, we’d love to have Jordan, we just can’t make a shoe work at this point in time.’ I wanted Michael to go with Nike because they were the big upstart."At the time, Jordan was so dead-set on signing with Adidas, he told Falk, "I have no interest in going (with Nike). Just do what you need to do to get me with Adidas,” according to ESPN's Darren Rovell.In hindsight, no price would have been too exorbitant for Adidas to offer Jordan in 1984. Nearly three decades later, Air Jordans are still considered royalty among sneakerheads everywhere. Had Jordan gotten his wish and signed with Adidas, who knows how different the basketball shoe landscape would look today.
The author of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's much-anticipated biography Omid Scobie has admitted it feels nice to 'finally be able to talk about' the project he's been 'beavering away at quietly for two years'.British journalist Omid Scobie, who has accompanied Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle, 38, on a variety of royal tours, took to the podcast The Heir Pod to discuss the release of the book.Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Family is set to be released worldwide online on August 11, with the hard copy on sale from August 20 and was released to pre-order over the weekend. And Omid admitted that their tale has included twists and turns that 'even the Sussexes didn't expect'. Speaking about finishing the biography, he said: 'It's been a long time in the making. The last few weeks have been quite a challenge getting it all ready in time for the deadline.He added: 'This project started about two years ago, and there have been twists and turns that no one expected. This is something no one expected.'I don't even think Harry and Meghan, who by their own account struggled with the realities of the situation, expected things to turn out the way they did.'Explaining that the biography gives a real inside account of their story, he said: 'I've been on so many engagements and around them as much as possible, and spoken to so many people in their lives, so no stone has been left unturned.'I've seen the couple remain faithful in their own beliefs and stand strong in the face of adversities which have been publicly played out in the press, and I would like to think this tells the definitive version of their lives together.' Publishing house Harper Collins, which owns Dey Street Books, the publisher of the biography released a brief description of Meghan and Prince Harry's collaboration with the two journalists.The book's description says that 'few know the true story of Harry and Meghan'. It promises to go 'beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan's life together, dispelling the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond'.It continues: 'With unique access and written with the participation of those closest to the couple, Finding Freedom is an honest, up-close, and disarming portrait of a confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition, determined to create a new path away from the spotlight, and dedicated to building a humanitarian legacy that will make a profound difference in the world.'The cover features a beaming Prince Harry and Meghan as they visited their namesake county in October 2018 for the first time.  The Mail on Sunday were told that before moving to North America, the Sussexes gave an interview to the book's authors, both journalists.One of them, Omid Scobie, is thought to be close to Meghan and was one of the favoured journalists given details of the couple's video call to the Queen last week in which they wished her a happy 94th birthday. Echoing Princess Diana's secret involvement in the blockbuster biography, Diana: Her True Story, when she encouraged her friends to speak to author Andrew Morton, questions are being asked whether members of Meghan's inner circle were being urged to help Scobie and his American co-author, Carolyn Durand. The 320-page biography, due to be released in August, is expected to be a global bestseller.  
Ten former NFL players, including former Washington Redskins star running back Clinton Portis, have been charged in a brazen $3.9 million scheme to submit false claims to a health program run by the league, prosecutors said Thursday.The players are accused in indictments filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Kentucky of claiming reimbursements for expensive medical equipment that was never actually purchased.The equipment included hyperbaric oxygen chambers, cryotherapy devices, ultrasound equipment used to perform imaging on pregnant women, and even electromagnetic therapy devices used to treat horses, the government said.The claims were typically for $40,000 to $50,000 apiece. The defendants allegedly fabricated documentation to submit for the claims, including invoices, prescriptions and letters of medical necessity, according to the Justice Department.“By defrauding the plan and treating it like their own personal ATM machine, sadly, the defendants placed the plan’s tax-exempt status at risk and threatened the ability of law-abiding former players to continue to receive tax-free reimbursements for legitimate medical expenses for themselves or their families,” said assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski.Prosecutors said some of the players acted as “ringleaders” in the scheme and recruited other former footballers, who paid them kickbacks and bribes out of some of the fraudulently obtained reimbursements.The kickbacks reached more than $10,000 per claim.The allegedly bogus claims were submitted to the Gene Upshaw National Football League Health Reimbursement Account Plan, which since 2006 has provided tax-free reimbursement for out-of-pocket medical costs of former players, their wives and dependents of up to $350,000 per player.More than $3.9 million in false and fraudulent claims were filed, and the plan paid out more than $3.4 million from June 2017 through December 2018, according to prosecutors. Authorities said there were two conspiracies to defraud the plan involving different players.The fraud was stopped when the health insurer Cigna became suspicious of some of the high-priced claims, including ones for equipment used to treat horses, and stopped paying the claims and notified authorities, prosecutors said.“This investigation serves as an illustration of the rampant and deliberate scams against health-care plans occurring daily throughout the country,” said Special Agent in Charge George Piro of the FBI’s Miami Field Office.Others charged are Robert McCune, a former Redskins linebacker, and John Eubanks, who had played cornerback for Washington.Charges also were filed against Tamarick Vanover, a former wide receiver with the Kansas City Chiefs and San Diego Chargers, Ceandris Brown, who had played safety with the Houston Texans and New York Giants, former Giants safety James Butler, along with Frederick Bennett, Etric Pruitt, Correll Buckhalter and Carlos Rogers.Four of the former players were arrested, and six have agreed to surrender, prosecutors said. Charges against the 10 include conspiracy, health care fraud and wire fraud.Two other defendants, Joseph Horn and Donald “Reche” Caldwell, are expected to be charged with a so-called criminal information alleging conspiracy to commit health-care fraud.Informations are charging devices regularly used against defendants who have reached an agreement with prosecutors to plead guilty.McCune, Eubanks, Vanover, Buckhalter and Rogers are among those accused of being ringleaders.“After the claims were submitted, McCune and Buckhalter allegedly called the telephone number provided by the Plan and impersonated certain other players in order to check on the status of the false and fraudulent claims,” the Justice Department said in a press release.
A man who returned to the UK to avoid coronavirus has said he "should never have left China" as things return to normal in Wuhan.Matt Raw, from Cheshire, said he went "out of the pot, into the fire" when he was released from two-week quarantine after returning at the end of January.He said his family came back to escape the "killer virus running loose".He believes China has done "everything right" acting more quickly than the UK to restrict the spread of the disease.Mr Raw, who lives in Wuhan with his wife, Ying, 38, and his 75-year-old mother, Hazel, said when the family left China, coronavirus was not in England.They were among 83 British passengers flown out of Wuhan following the outbreak and had to stay in quarantine in Wirral in an accommodation block for NHS staff.Mr Raw said: "I think the first case was while we were in quarantine in Arrowe Park, and I thought 'They have seen what happened in China, they will jump on this straight away'."They did nothing."'Control of situation'Mr Raw said for friends and family in Wuhan things were starting to get back to normal.He said: "They're out of lockdown, it looks like they've got control of the situation."They're still being sensible, taking precautions and not going out unnecessarily."Mr Raw said he will not return to China until there is a vaccine for Covid-19 making it safe for his mother, who has dementia, to travel.He praised his neighbours where he is now living in Knutsford who have been supporting each other, making it all "very, very bearable indeed".He said: "I would rather be in quarantine over here than in China, but I think, very definitely, that coming back here was a mistake."We've made our bed so we just have to put on a happy face and lie in it now."
Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong had just begun letting its guard down in late February when it was hit by a second wave of the novel coronavirus.After a brief period of low case numbers, new infections spiked dramatically, prompting a series of additional stringent restrictions.That second wave now appears to have largely passed. Hong Kong hasn't had a case of local transmission in more than two weeks, and the city is cautiously resuming normal life.Hong Kong's success in surviving multiple waves of the virus provides hard earned lessons to other cities around the world now looking to relax restrictions.In total, Hong Kong has recorded only 15 new cases since April 20, all of which were people with recent travel history. That brings the city's total to 1,041 cases and four deaths. Of those total cases, 900 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital.The coronavirus first emerged in mainland China in December, and jumped the border into Hong Kong on January 24. By then, it had already made its way to several other countries.Hong Kong closed borders and began social distancing just a week or so after recording its first case. But this three-month stretch of working from home, business closures and service suspensions has dealt a massive blow to both the city's economy and the mental health and wellbeing of residents.Now, with the second wave mostly contained, many are itching to get back to pre-pandemic life."I do feel very strongly, and also echoed by many people in society, that the time for some relaxation, for some lifting of the restrictions that we put on this social contact has come," said the city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, on Tuesday, shortly before announcing the loosening of some restrictions.The new guidelines, which will go into effect Friday, will allow more people to gather in public and some businesses to reopen.But Lam and other health experts are also cautioning people not to let their guard down too soon, as they did in February. With the virus still wreaking havoc on the rest of the world, it's too soon to celebrate, she warned."I must stress that this epidemic may come back. As the WHO (World Health Organization) said not long ago ... we must remain vigilant," Lam said last week.How Hong Kong contained its second waveIn Hong Kong, public panic peaked in early February, with crowds stockpiling toilet paper, face masks and groceries until supermarket aisles were empty citywide.But the actual number of cases remained relatively low; by the start of March, the city only had about 150 coronavirus cases, despite sharing a border with mainland China where the virus first emerged.Then, as the coronavirus pandemic moved beyond China and hit the West, shuttering universities and raising alarm, Hong Kong students and residents began returning to the city in waves -- bringing the virus back with them. By the end of the month, case numbers had surged past 700.The government took quick, aggressive action to curb the second imported wave; they barred non-residents from entering the city, halted travelers from transiting through the city's airport, and implemented strict quarantine and testing measures on all arrivals to the city, regardless of origin. Those under home quarantine were given electronic bracelets to track their location.The government implemented restrictions like prohibiting alcohol sales in bars and closing all gyms and sports facilities. Many restaurants and cafes closed; those that stayed open had to cut down seating capacity to increase the distance between customers, or put up physical barriers between tables.Though many of these measures were viewed by some as drastic, authorities never ordered an official lockdown or stay-at-home order, relying instead on community efforts and peoples' compliance to contain the virus.This approach appears to have worked, with new daily cases dropping once again. April 19 was the last recorded local transmission.Cautious return to normal lifeThe government and the public are now cautiously turning their focus to resuming life and business in the city, and transitioning from survival to healing."I think right now the immediate priority is definitely to revive the economy because after all, we have been subject to many restrictions on all you can imagine in the past few months due to Covid-19," said Christopher Hui, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, on May 2.On Monday, the government reopened recreational and sports spaces like tennis courts, resumed some services like drivers' license tests and classes, and resumed community services for vulnerable populations like the disabled and elderly.Starting Friday, the number of people permitted to gather in public will be raised from four to eight. Some businesses like fitness centers, beauty salons, massage parlors and bars will be allowed to reopen, albeit with restrictions like a cap on customers.Schools will also gradually reopen from May 27, with students returning to classrooms in batches and staggered phases.The public has wholeheartedly embraced this loosening of restrictions as summer arrives. The past two weekends have seen beaches, hiking trails, and campgrounds packed with people. Restaurants are filling up again, with nightly lines out the door for some, and others booked up for the next few weeks. It's been a long, draining three months of pandemic -- and people are eager to let loose.But medical experts in the city are warning residents not to relax completely yet. It's too soon to say local transmissions have entirely stopped, said Dr. Chuang Shuk-kwan of the Centre for Health Protection on Monday.Since the virus' incubation period is up to 14 days, authorities would need to see two full incubation periods -- 28 days -- without infections to declare an end to local transmissions, Chuang said.And there's another concern looming on the horizon now -- the return of social unrest. The city was rocked by six months of often violent pro-democracy anti-government protests in 2019, which came to a halt during the pandemic. Now, there are signs that as the danger of coronavirus subsides, protesters are gearing up to return to the streets.There have already been a handful of small-scale protests in the past two weeks -- and authorities, too, are getting ready for potential clashes."Hong Kong has consecutively seen zero cases of the coronavirus," posted Lam on Facebook last week. "At the moment we are able to withstand the pandemic ... Hong Kong was able to withstand the harsh winter, but I worry Hong Kong may be unable to withstand the resurgence of violence of the continuous devastation caused by politics." 
Arizona is taking steps to gradually reopen, but many people may be nervous about venturing out and doing too much too quickly. Stepping outside your house to view the so-called Super Flower Moon this week, however, is a comfortable and a safe way to end the day. The best night for seeing the Super Flower Moon is Wednesday, May 6. But a nearly full moon on Thursday evening will make for great viewing that evening as well. The best time to view the supermoon is while it rises in the sky because the contrast against buildings and trees makes the moon appear even larger. On Wednesday night, the moonrise is at 6:40 p.m. in the Phoenix area. On Thursday, the moonrise is at 7:52 p.m. If you live outside the Phoenix area, enter your city's name into this website to find moonrise times for your area."There’s a lot of neat stuff to look at in the sky, but the moon is right up there as one of my favorites because you can see so much without any equipment," said Kevin Schindler, a historian at Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff.Moon activities for the familySchindler recommends three activities that can make moon gazing more fun and interactive:See who can spot the moon first. Go outside a few minutes before the moon rises and try to guess exactly where the moon will appear over the horizon. Will it appear over this fence post? Or that tree? Observe how the color changes. As it rises, the moon takes on a pink-orange glow, which is due to the Earth's atmosphere. A couple hours later, the moon appears gray and white when it's high in the sky. Watch a special program on the moon live from Arizona. Lowell Observatory will host an hour-long show on the internet, beginning at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday. The livestream will feature pictures and maps, and a discussion of the moon's geography and formation. What is a supermoon?Supermoons happen a few times a year when the moon is closest to the Earth in its orbit. The name comes from appearing about 14% larger and 30% brighter than a typical full moon. The May supermoon is known as the "flower moon," because flowers typically cover the ground in many parts of the country. When is the next supermoon?If you miss the May supermoon, you will have to wait almost a year for the next one. The next supermoon won't make an appearance until April 27, 2021.    
An emergency proclamation issued Thursday in Stillwater, Oklahoma, requiring the use of face masks in stores and restaurants was amended Friday after threats of violence."In the short time beginning on May 1, 2020, that face coverings have been required for entry into stores/restaurants, store employees have been threatened with physical violence and showered with verbal abuse," Stillwater City Manager Norman McNickle said in a statement."In addition, there has been one threat of violence using a firearm. This has occurred in three short hours and in the face of clear medical evidence that face coverings helps contain the spread of Covid-19."Due to the threats of violence the city has decided to amend their emergency order but still want people to wear face masks whenever possible, the statement said. The proclamation issued Thursday required, among other things, businesses to require patrons to cover their faces to combat the spread of coronavirus.But on Friday, Mayor Will Joyce softened the rule to encourage, not require, face coverings, after several reports emerged of employees being verbally abused and being threatened with physical violence while trying to enforce the order -- all in just three hours of the rule going into effect."Many of those with objections cite the mistaken belief the requirement is unconstitutional, and under their theory, one cannot be forced to wear a mask. No law or court supports this view," said City Manager Norman McNickle in a statement. "It is further distressing that these people, while exercising their believed rights, put others at risk."McNickle went on to explain the importance of face coverings in preventing the spread of coronavirus. The masks have been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Oklahoma State Department of Health."It is unfortunate and distressing that those who refuse and threaten violence are so self-absorbed as to not follow what is a simple show of respect and kindness to others," he said.Still, the city is changing the rule, as officials "cannot, in clear conscience, put our local business community in harm's way, nor can the police be everywhere," McNickle said.Since April 3, the CDC has recommended that Americans should wear "cloth coverings" in public places.The updated guidance was in light of new evidence that many people were spreading the virus asymptomatically -- meaning that even people not exhibiting symptoms were spreading it by coughing, sneezing or even simply talking in close proximity."The idea about the face mask is to prevent the virus from coming out of somebody's mouth and nose, mostly out of their mouth," said Dr. Joseph Vinetz, a professor in the infectious disease section at Yale School of Medicine, to CNN in April. "They prevent somebody, when they talk or sometimes when they sneeze or cough, from expelling virus and leading to infection in other people."Masks, however, are not a substitute for social distancing, which is still required to slow the spread of the virus.
PARIS (Reuters) - French Defence Minister Florence Parly is heading for Mali to honor the 13 French soldiers killed during an operation on Tuesday, the Defence Ministry said on Wednesday.The soldiers died in Mali when their helicopters collided as they hunted for Islamist militants.
Though industry giants like Apple, Samsung, and Google have been pricing their new smartphones at about $1,000 over the past two years, new data shows that such a cost is simply too high for most people.Less than 10% of people in the United States are spending more than $1,000 on a new smartphone, NPD Group's recent market research found. The firm gathered the data using its Mobile Phone Tracking tool, which uses advertising technology to monitor active devices in the US.The study is the latest evidence suggesting that tech companies have had a hard time convincing people to upgrade to new devices each year as prices increase. The market research firm Kantar Worldpanel reported in 2018 that the average life cycle of a smartphone increased by roughly two months from 2016 to 2018, indicating that people were holding on to their devices longer before upgrading.Global smartphone shipments in general have also been struggling. The industry suffered seven consecutive quarterly declines until the third quarter of 2019, when shipments rose by 0.8% year-over-year, according to the International Data Corporation.Some of the world's most influential tech companies have shifted their smartphone launch strategies in recent years to reflect this change. 2019 saw a wave of less expensive smartphone launches, like the $750 Galaxy S10e from Samsung, the $480 Pixel 3a from Google, and the $700 iPhone 11.The $1,000 price point became the norm for flagship smartphones relatively recently as phones gained advanced features like facial recognition, nearly borderless screens, and triple-lens cameras.Apple launched the $1,000 iPhone X in 2017, but before that, its flagship iPhone 7 was priced at $650, or $770 if you opted for the version with a larger screen and two cameras. (It also debuted the less expensive $700 iPhone 8 alongside the iPhone X in 2017.)The same can be said for Samsung: While the 2016 Galaxy S7 was priced at about $650, the Galaxy S8 started at about $720 in 2017 — not quite as expensive as the iPhone X but nonetheless pricier than its predecessor.This year, Samsung's flagship Galaxy S10 started at $1,000, while Apple's iPhone 11 Pro began at the same price.As prices increased and smartphone sales slumped, companies like Apple, Samsung, and Google revised their smartphone price strategies.Apple, for example, launched the $750 iPhone XR alongside its $1,000-plus iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max last year. And in 2019 it positioned the $700 iPhone 11 as its new flagship device, whereas the pricier $1,000-and-higher models with triple-lens cameras were designated the "Pro" versions. That alone could be interpreted as Apple's acknowledgment that a $1,000 smartphone isn't for everyone.Samsung, too, launched a less expensive version of the Galaxy S10 this year with its $750 Galaxy S10e, a smaller version of the S10 that lacks some features like an in-screen fingerprint sensor.In May, Google released a cheaper version of its Pixel 3 called the Pixel 3a, which starts at $480 and comes with several of the same features as the 2018 Pixel 3."When we saw this happening, we participated again in premium smartphones but said we need to offer an alternative," Mario Queiroz, who was Google's general manager and vice president of product management for Pixel before recently moving into a new role at the company, previously told Business Insider.Launching more than one flagship smartphone isn't new for companies like Apple, Samsung, and Google. But whereas Apple and Samsung would usually launch two smartphone models in different screen sizes before 2017, recently they've shifted toward debuting even more devices at various price points, appealing to people with differing budgets.The introduction of more 5G devices next year is expected to further fuel smartphone upgrades, as Cristiano Amon, president of the market-leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm recently told Business Insider.But considering that 5G phones are typically more expensive than non-5G models — Samsung's Galaxy S10 5G, for example, launched at $1,300 in May — people might be reluctant to adopt 5G, NPD said."Overall awareness and purchase intent reported by consumers is high," Brad Akyuz, the executive director and industry analyst at NPD Connected Intelligence, said in the research firm's announcement of the study. "But only a small segment of the market can afford these $1,000+ devices."
Andy Dalton has signed a one-year deal worth up to $7 million with the Dallas Cowboys, including $3 million guaranteed, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Cowboys confirmed the signing on Saturday night.Dalton, 32, is a Texas native who already owns a home in the Dallas area. He played college football at Texas Christian, helping the Horned Frogs defeat the Wisconsin Badgers in the 2011 Rose Bowl. The Bengals' second-round pick in the 2011 draft, Dalton spent nine seasons in Cincinnati, helping the team clinch five playoff berths. Dalton, who lost his starting job last season to then-rookie Ryan Finley, was released by the Bengals on Thursday following the selection of Joe Burrow with the No. 1 overall pick in this year's NFL Draft.Dalton helped lead the Bengals to two AFC North division titles and five straight playoff appearances. In the process, Dalton, who posted a 70-61-2 regular season record as Cincinnati's starting quarterback, was selected to three Pro Bowls while moving past Carson Palmer and Boomer Esiason as the franchise's second all-time leading passer. He is the franchise's all-time leader in career touchdown passes (204), fourth-quarter comebacks (20) and game-winning drives (24). Dalton was unable to lead the Bengals to victory in the postseason, however, as Cincinnati is still awaiting their first playoff victory since 1990. In Dallas, Dalton will now back up Dak Prescott, who was franchise tagged by the Cowboys earlier this offseason. The Cowboys are still trying to come to a long-term contract agreement with Prescott, who set career highs with 4,902 yards and 30 touchdowns last season. Dalton joins a Cowboys quarterback room that also includes Cooper Rush, Clayton Thorson, and rookie Ben DiNucci. According to the latest projections calculated by CBS Sports' Stephen Oh, if the Cowboys were to have a falling out with Prescott and slot Dalton in as the starter, there would naturally be a noticeable drop-off in Dallas' playoff chances. With Dalton over Prescott, the club's win projection falls from 9.3 to 8.5, win percentage goes from 58.1% to 53.1%, the chances of winning the NFC East fall 14.1%, and the odds of making the playoffs dips from 69.2% with Prescott to 52.6% with Dalton. As for Dallas' odds to win Super Bowl LV, it only drops 1% with Dalton under center over Prescott. While there are certainly some sizable differences, the price tags on both of these quarterbacks will also vary as Prescott is projected to see a contact that could pay him up to $40 million annually, which is a far cry from the $7 million Dalton can make with this stint in Dallas.  Dalton is the latest former franchise quarterback to accept a backup role with a new team. Jameis Winston, who led the NFL in passing yards and interceptions thrown last season, signed a one-year deal with the Saints shortly after the draft. Cam Newton, the 2015 league MVP, is still on the open market after being released by the Panthers back in March. 
David Harris's world has shrunk to the size of his front room.Seven weeks ago he developed Covid-19 symptoms that he describes as being like a bad flu.That was when the freelance architect, 42, first began to isolate himself at the home in Bristol he shares with his wife and baby daughter.After a week or so he started to feel better, but two weeks later his symptoms returned, much to his surprise."It's been a bit of a mini-saga of a recurring wave of symptoms which I wasn't expecting at all," he said."The second wave was much worse - the same flu symptoms, but also with shortness of breath, and that's why I was confident it was coronavirus."Then I had two weeks where I thought I was getting better, I was just very tired."And then on week seven, I relapsed again and had my third wave, luckily much milder but still significant."Working on the basis it was better to be safe than sorry, David continued to self-isolate, changing into clean clothes on the rare occasions he left the front room to visit the bathroom, and eating and sleeping alone.His wife would bring their 10-month-old daughter Millie to the window of the front room so David could see her through the glass.The illness left David exhausted and uncertain what was going to happen next."Probably one of the most stressful things is trying to work out at what point you ask for help."You don't want to pester the NHS, because there are obviously people in much worse situations than me."But certainly, at my weakest moment I didn't want to fall into the trap of not asking for help and then something bad happening because you didn't ask for help."When I first relapsed, when I first got worse, it's quite a scary experience because you don't know if that means you're going down, down, down."So it is quite scary to get worse when you thought you were getting better."'It's lingering on'Allison Needham is still experiencing symptoms a month after her 'recovery' from Covid-19."The other night I constantly woke up, gasping for breath - they call it being 'air hungry'."When people say shortness of breath, it's more like you've forgotten to breathe and you have to take huge breath, literally a huge gasp."It adds to the exhaustion and for me, that's the worst thing."Her problems started with a cough over the Easter weekend which she initially thought was hay fever. But within a few days she was really ill - back and muscle pain, tender skin, severe headaches, chills.Allison ,56, has no underlying health conditions.She works for the NHS in Sheffield and so was able to get a test that confirmed she had COVID-19.She assumed she'd be better by now, but the illness lingers on."If you feel a bit better, as soon as you start to do something it knocks you off your feet again."I get a surging, burning feeling in my chest, which can be a bit scary, but I don't panic anymore."Allison feels she - and thousands like her - are not getting the help they need.A Facebook group has linked her with many others going through a similar experience - people who feel their condition is being overlooked as they struggle to regain their health."I am worried about getting back to work and how long this could go on for."I do feel people should be re-tested, even if it's just to offer reassurance that you're no longer contagious as I feel like I still have it - the symptoms are the same."Extreme agonyFelicity, 49, from London, is six weeks into her recovery after first falling ill with Covid-type symptoms.But like David, her experience has been far from smooth."I think the hardest part was having gone through the first 10 days of being very sick and thinking I was getting better, things then getting much, much worse again."So it was actually in the fifth week of being ill that my partner had to call A&E because I was experiencing such horrific abdominal pains that I was just calling out in just extreme agony."It's so difficult to know, is that the work of the virus? Is it the immune system's response? Is it ongoing inflammation?"I had no problems in my stomach before falling sick, but week five was just horrendous."Neither Felicity nor David has been tested for Covid-19, but both were told by doctors they probably had the virus.They have also been assured they are no longer infectious.But Felicity struggled to shake off her symptoms and the weeks of illness have taken their toll."I spend a huge amount of time in bed trying to recover."This entire experience, of being sick and trying to recover, has been mentally overwhelming."Most recover quicklyPart of the problem is that so much about the coronavirus is unknown, including why some people experience relatively mild symptoms lasting a few days, while other perfectly healthy people are left struggling for weeks.Dr Philip Gothard, a consultant physician at London's Hospital for Tropical Diseases, says the vast majority of patients make a full and fairly rapid recovery."Some will have a persisting cough and we're beginning to see patients who've got profound fatigue and exhaustion that goes on perhaps three, four, five or six weeks."It's very distressing if you're an otherwise young healthy person, it's something you're not used to."And so it comes as a shock that recovery is slow and stuttering."But in many patients with other diseases who are recovering from an acute illness you do tend to see this kind of waxing and waning effect as you are slowly getting better, and you have good days and bad days."Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, says data emerging from the Covid Symptom Study app shows that, on average, it takes people 12 days to start slowly recovering."We are also seeing a significant number of people reporting symptoms that can go on much longer than this, in some cases for 30 days or more."As we collect more data and continue to use machine-learning and artificial intelligence, we will soon be able to identify which combination of symptoms and risk factors make a person more or less likely to suffer from these longer terms symptoms."David and Felicity both hope they are now finally recovering and can start to return to normal life.But Covid-19, an illness that is still only a few months old, continues to spring surprises on us, and none of them welcome. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s call to break up big agriculture has stirred a debate, but industry groups are fighting back, with one group saying her “proposals seriously miss the mark.”“You’ve got these giant corporations that are making bigger and bigger profits for themselves, for their executives, for their investors, and they’re putting the squeeze on family farms, on small farms,” the Democratic presidential hopeful told attendees at the Heartland Forum in Storm Lake, Iowa, on Saturday. “Twenty years ago, 600 different outfits were selling seed; today it’s basically six.”The senator also released a policy post on Medium last week that focused on “leveling the playing field for America’s family farmers.”But big agribusiness groups suggest Warren’s policy proposals are detached from reality and say what’s needed is a focus on growing exports, not adding regulations.The Massachusetts Democrat has criticized “immense market power” created by mergers and expansion, targeting seed giants, big chicken companies and meat processors. The Democrat also has vowed to install “trustbusters to review — and reverse — anti-competitive mergers.”“We disagree with the premise and the policies outlined,” said Jim Monroe, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, a trade group. “The U.S. pork production system is the envy of the world. It is also highly export dependent. What U.S. pork producers and the other American farm families need are expanded export opportunities, not more regulations.”Warren has also been critical of the government’s commodity checkoff programs, funded by farmers, that are used to promote products such as soybeans, milk, beef and pork. She backs a bill, reintroduced last week by a bipartisan group of senators, to reform the commodity programs and wants farmer checkoff payments to be voluntary. She said the system is now “rigged against family farmers.”“If Senator Warren’s goal is to help cattle farmers and ranchers, her policy proposals seriously miss the mark,” said Colin Woodall, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a trade group. “The ideas she outlines are nothing more than recycled policies promoted by some of the leading opponents of animal agriculture.”Warren’s campaign did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment.Warren also targeted recent mergers involving Bayer-Monsanto, Dow-Dupont and Syngenta-ChemChina — companies supplying seeds and other products to farmers. She singled out those companies last week in her policy post and called for the breakup of big agricultural mergers.“Agriculture is a complex and highly competitive industry, and there are hundreds of companies driving innovation and competing for farmers’ business,” said Christi Dixon, a Bayer spokesperson. “After a robust global regulatory review process, we brought together two talented teams and a robust portfolio to offer more choices for farmers.”Dow referred inquiries to the industry trade group. Syngenta declined comment.“Much of the consolidation we have seen in recent years is the result of the need and desire of our members to continue to innovate and invest in new, more targeted technologies,” said Chris Novak, president and CEO of CropLife America, a biotech industry trade group.Novak said companies require on average more than 11 years and some $300 million to bring a chemistry product to market. But the considerable time and hefty outlay needed to go through the regulatory process make it tough for small companies to make these investments, he said.“Through the consolidation process, we have seen divestiture of assets that has allowed other companies to acquire new and more diverse portfolios,” he said. “This has created a more competitive marketplace.”Warren’s policy paper said the two biggest seed makers, Monsanto and DuPont, together had just over 70 percent market share of the corn seed market before they were acquired.She said “conservative estimates” have the merged Bayer-Monsanto with “more than 37 percent” domestic market share of the vegetable seed market and “more than half of the market for some vegetables.”The National Farmers Union, a group representing family farmers, sides with Warren. The group is concerned about the impact of recent industry deals and testified against the three big seed mergers when they were still pending.“When you get to a place in a sector of the economy where 40 to 50 percent of that business volume is represented by four or fewer players, you have by definition what most economists would say is a non-competitive [market], or at least a market that is less competitive than it ought to be,” said Roger Johnson, president of the group.Johnson said farmers’ choice is more limited due to the mergers. He also said agricultural producers are “getting squeezed on both” ends by paying more than they should for products and getting lower prices when selling their commodities “because of highly concentrated markets that are paying less to us.”
Scientists have discovered an antibody which prevents the coronavirus from infecting human cells in "groundbreaking research" which could lead to the development of new treatments.Building on research into the SARS coronavirus, scientists from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, as well as the Erasmus Medical Centre and the company Harbour BioMed (HBM), have identified a potential method of neutralising COVID-19.They discovered that an antibody which prevents the SARS virus from infecting human cells could also block the novel coronavirus from infecting human cells too, according a peer reviewed study published on Monday in the journal Nature Communications.Testing their collection of antibodies on cultured human cells, researchers discovered one which binds to a specific part which is present in both SARS and the virus causing COVID-19.The discovery could offer an initial step towards developing a fully-human antibody to treat or prevent the disease, which has infected more then 3.5 million people worldwide, and led to more than 247,000 deaths.The neutralising antibody "has potential to alter the course of infection in the infected host, support virus clearance or protect an uninfected individual that is exposed to the virus," said Dr Berend-Jan Bosch, co-lead author on the study.Dr Frank Grosveld, the study's other co-lead author, said the discovery provided "a strong foundation for additional research to characterise this antibody and begin development as a potential COVID-19 treatment"."The antibody used in this work is 'fully human', allowing development to proceed more rapidly and reducing the potential for immune-related side effects," he added.The fully-human antibody is different from conventional therapeutic antibodies, which are often first developed in other species before being "humanised" so they can be transmitted to people.It was developed using Harbour BioMed's H2L2 transgenic mouse technology - effectively a mouse which has been genetically engineered to contain human genes, enabling researchers to develop "human" antibodies without testing them on living people."This is groundbreaking research," said Dr Jingsong Wang, the chief executive of HBM. 
Actor Robert Redford penned an op-ed Tuesday calling the Trump administration a “monarchy in disguise” and stressing the importance of preserving U.S. democracy by voting the president out next year.“We’re up against a crisis I never thought I’d see in my lifetime: a dictator-like attack by President Donald Trump on everything this country stands for,” the 83-year-old Oscar winner and Sundance Film Festival founder wrote for NBC News.“As last week’s impeachment hearings made clear, our shared tolerance and respect for the truth, our sacred rule of law, our essential freedom of the press and our precious freedoms of speech — all have been threatened by a single man,” he continued.Mr. Redford wrote that while he wanted to give Mr. Trump the benefit of the doubt in the beginning, he was “almost instantly” alarmed by the president’s behavior once in office. He argued that it’s “time for Trump to go” as well as the Republican lawmakers who have stood behind him.“Tonight it pains me to watch what is happening to our country,” he wrote. “Growing up as a child during World War II, I watched a united America defend itself against the threat of fascism. I watched this again, during the Watergate crisis, when our democracy was threatened. And again, when terrorists turned our world upside down.“During those times of crises, Congress came together, and our leaders came together. Politicians from both sides rose to defend our founding principles and the values that make us a global leader and a philosophical beacon of hope for all those seeking their own freedoms,” he continued. “What is happening, right now, is so deeply disturbing that instead of the United States of America, we are now defined as the Divided States of America. Leaders on both sides lack the fundamental courage to cross political aisles on behalf of what is good for the American people.”Mr. Redford went on to call the Trump administration a “monarchy in disguise” that has been so “exhausting and chaotic” that it’s caused many Americans to tune out.“But this is it,” he warned. “There are only 11 months left before the presidential election; 11 months before we get our one real chance to right this ship and change the course of disaster that lies before us.”
Airbnb  has debuted a new extension of its growing business in providing travel experiences in addition to temporary housing. Called Airbnb Adventures, it’s effectively a collection of tours and trips lasting between three days and a week that go beyond the usual city walking tour.One such trip, for example, is a wildlife excursion in Kenya that spans three days and centers around a walking trip with a promise to “encounter lions,” as well as a campfire learning session and “bush tea.” The cost is $500 per person, which includes five meals, drinks and two nights’ stay in a tent.To source these “adventures,” Airbnb is working with local experts and tour companies, and doing so directly rather than working with larger tour providers that can be a one-to-many connection for sourcing like it does with some of its more vanilla Experiences. The direct route is probably necessary for these types of experiences, which have more implications in terms of liability and insurance. The company is also working with a third-party for verifying the certifications that are often required to provide these kinds of activities safely.Airbnb is increasingly investing in ares that complement its core product of short-term peer-to-peer vacation housing rentals, and it debuted Experiences, of which Adventures is a part, in 2016. It’s also recently been reported that the company is exploring streaming media. It’s also expected to go public sometime this year, and recently claimed profitability in its operations.
BOSTON -- Joel Embiid heard the criticism directed at him by Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal.And according to Embiid, they are right."Maybe they're right. Maybe. I do think they're right," Embiid said. "I think I need to be more aggressive and just look to impose myself and look to dominate."I think the whole season I haven't done that, and you can see the way it has affected my efficiency and my stats, so I guess I need to go back to having fun and just dominating. But I get what they are saying, and I think they are right, man. I have to make a change."While Embiid had 22 points, 10 rebounds and six assists going up against fellow All-NBA center Nikola Jokic on Tuesday night, that wasn't good enough in the eyes of Barkley and O'Neal, as they both criticized Embiid for his effort and failing to dominate games in the way they think he should."He's the toughest player in the league to match up with," Barkley said on TNT after it showed the game Tuesday. "But we don't talk about him the way we talk about Luka [Doncic], Giannis [Antetokounmpo], Anthony Davis, James [Harden]. We don't ever say that about him."As for O'Neal, he said, "We're telling you, 'You can be great. You ain't playing hard enough.' Twenty-two [points] ain't enough to get you to the next level."Do you want to be great, or do you want to be good? If you want to be good, keep doing 22 points. You want to be great, give me 28, give me 30. You want to be great, watch Giannis; he wants to be great."Embiid's averages this season are still eye-popping -- 22 points, 12.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists entering Thursday night's nationally televised game against the Boston Celtics -- but his shooting percentage (45.8) is the lowest of his career, and he has clearly been affected by the way the Sixers chose to remake their team in the offseason.By moving on from JJ Redick -- who had brilliant chemistry with Embiid during their two seasons together in Philadelphia -- and signing Al Horford, an already spacing-challenged offense became even more so. That, coupled with Embiid playing fewer minutes in an effort to stay healthy for the playoffs, has left him trying to find a rhythm in a new environment."I mean, I said earlier that I want to get to the playoffs healthy," Embiid said. "The last two years I was not healthy. Two years ago, it was my face, and then last year it was my knee and I was sick. This year, I kind of told myself I want to get there healthy."We got a new group. I'm still trying to get used to it. It's different. It's completely different. The way I'm being guarded this year, every time I touch the ball, heavy double-, triple-teams."[I'm] just trying to navigate through it. Just be a basketball player, make the right plays. If I get double-teamed, my teammates know I'm going to pass it, so it's about balancing between trying to make something happen for your team and making the right play."On a team with shooters around him, perhaps Embiid would have the kind of spacing that would allow him to relentlessly attack single coverage inside. But that isn't what life in Philadelphia is like for Embiid. Instead, the 76ers are the biggest team in the league across the board, leaning into the strengths of their best player and trying to beat opponents into submission at both ends of the court.That begins with Embiid, one of the league's best defensive players and its most dominant force in the post. But he said he knows that if he has an off game, people will look at him -- like Barkley and O'Neal did -- and expect more."That's the high standard that I guess that I set," Embiid said. "It just feels like if I don't score 35 points or, I don't know, 40 points, it feels like it's a down game, even when I have 30. It's just the way it is. I signed up for it."I want to be great. I put the work in to be at this level and to be better, and I still feel like I have a lot of potential and people feel the same way, so it's only right for people to expect me to, like Shaq and Charles said, to drop 35 a night."I'm not a selfish player. I take whatever the defense gives me. If they're going to double-team me all night and I only take two shots, I'll do that too. I've got to play within the concept of the game and follow whatever the team wants me to do. I've been following it, and if it takes me taking five shots a game, I guess I've got to do it."Gordon Hayward took a hit to the face Wednesday night in a loss to the Indiana Pacers, but the Celtics said he is probable to play against the Sixers. Marcus Smart (eye infection) and Robert Williams (hip) remain out.For Philadelphia, Horford -- who is back in Boston for the first time since he left the Celtics to sign with the Sixers as a free agent this summer -- is questionable to play with a sore left knee and left hamstring tightness.
SpaceX completed Friday the last drop test of the Dragon crew capsule’s parachutes before the first launch of astronauts on the human-rated ship May 27, while technicians at Cape Canaveral have mated the spacecraft’s crew module with its unpressurized trunk section.The drop test from a C-130 cargo plane Friday was the 27th and final test of the “Mark 3” parachute design SpaceX will use for the Crew Dragon spacecraft. Drogue parachutes and then four main chutes unfurled from a test vehicle designed to mimic the Crew Dragon’s weight during return to Earth.SpaceX said in a tweet that the parachute test moves the Crew Dragon “one step closer” to flying NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station, “and safely returning them back to Earth.Meanwhile, SpaceX’s Dragon processing team at Cape Canaveral have connected the spaceship’s pressurized crew module with the spacecraft’s rear trunk, which generates electricity through body-mounted solar panels and houses radiators for thermal control in orbit.The parachute and spacecraft processing milestones kick off a busy month of preparations ahead of the the Crew Dragon’s launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket set for May 27 from pad 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida.The test flight will head for the International Space Station, where Behnken and Hurley will live and work for one-to-four months before returning to Earth for a splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean just off Florida’s East Coast.The launch later this month will mark the first time astronauts have flown into Earth orbit from a U.S. spaceport since the retirement of the space shuttle in July 2011.“My heart is sitting right here (motioning to throat), and I think it’s going to stay there until we get Bob and Doug safely back from the International Space Station,” said Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s president and chief operating officer, in a press conference Friday. “But between now and then, there’s still work to do.”NASA has awarded SpaceX more than $3.1 billion since 2011 to develop, test and fly the Crew Dragon spacecraft. SpaceX has put in its own funding, but Shotwell could not provide a figure Friday for the level of internal funds SpaceX has spent on developing the crew capsule.The public-private partnership is a hallmark of NASA’s strategy since the end of the space shuttle program to commercialize transportation to and from low Earth orbit, beginning with cargo services for the space station pioneered by SpaceX’s Dragon capsule and the Cygnus supply ship owned by Northrop Grumman, formerly known as Orbital ATK.“This is a new generation, a new era in human spaceflight,” said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. “And when I say it’s new what I mean is, NASA has long had this idea that we need to purchase, own and operate hardware to get to space. In the past that has been true, but now, in this new era … NASA has an ability to be a customer, one customer of many customers in a very robust commercial marketplace in low Earth orbit.”NASA selected Boeing alongside SpaceX in 2014 to design and build new commercial spaceships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station. Boeing’s Starliner ship is unlikely to fly with astronauts until early 2021 after an unpiloted test flight in December encountered software trouble, preventing the capsule from docking with the space station.Bridenstine said NASA and SpaceX are continuing preparations for the Crew Dragon test flight — designated Demo-2 — amid the coronavirus pandemic while introducing new physical distancing guidelines for the astronauts and support teams.“We’re going to do it in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic,” Bridenstine said. “I’m going to tell you that this is a high-priority mission for the United States of America. We, as a nation, have not had our own access to the International Space Station for nine years.”In the time since the last shuttle flight, all astronauts traveling to the space station have flown aboard Russian Soyuz capsules. In the most recent agreement with Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, NASA paid the Russian government more than $80 million per round-trip seat on the Soyuz spacecraft.NASA’s inspector general last year reported the agency is paying SpaceX approximately $55 million per Crew Dragon seat.Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA’s commercial crew program, said Friday that NASA and SpaceX engineers are “making sure that all the Is are dotted and Ts are crossed” in preparation for the Crew Dragon launch.In parallel with hardware preparations at the Kennedy Space Center, SpaceX and NASA engineers are completing pre-flight data analyses, safety assessments and readiness reviews.The work in the coming weeks will make sure SpaceX and NASA “are ready for this important mission to safely fly Bob and Doug up to the International Space Station, serve as a lifeboat, and return them to their families,” Lueders said.“This is a humbling job,” she said. “I think we’re up to it.”Behnken, 49, will serve as joint operations commander for the Demo-2 mission, responsible for rendezvous, docking, undocking and other activities at the International Space Station. Hurley, 53, will be the spacecraft commander, responsible for launch, landing and recovery, according to NASA.Both astronauts joined NASA’s astronaut corps in 2000, and each has flown twice on space shuttle missions. Behnken and Hurley are also both married to other astronauts.“I think we have a different perspective of the importance of coming to Florida, launching again on an American rocket from the Florida coast,” Behnken said. “And generations of people who maybe didn’t get a chance to see a space shuttle launch, getting a chance again to see human spaceflight in our own backyard, if you will, is pretty exciting to be a part of.“I think that’s the thing that’s most exciting for me, as well as on my first flight, I didn’t have a small child,” he said. “I didn’t have a son, so I’m really excited to share the mission with him and have him have a chance to be old enough at six to see it and share it with me when I get home and while I’m on orbit.”Hurley piloted the shuttle Atlantis on the final space shuttle mission in July 2011.“It’s well past time to be launching an American rocket from the Florida coast to the International Space Station, and I am certainly honored to be part of it,” Hurley said.“We would be asked questions along the lines of, well, the space program is over because the shuttle is not flying,” Hurley said. “And that certainly was not the case. We’ve had people on board the International Space Station since the fall of 2000. And we continue to fly to the space station on Soyuz vehicles. So part of it was just a lack of understanding by the public as far as what we were continuing to do as an agency, but it was also the time it took to develop new vehicles in order to take their place, take the shuttle’s place, to get folks to and from the International Space Station from the United States.”Once Behnken and Hurley return to Earth, NASA will formally certify the Crew Dragon for regular crew rotation flights to the space station, each carrying four astronauts. Another Crew Dragon is scheduled for launch later this year with three NASA astronauts and a Japanese space flier.The Dragon crew has essentially been in quarantine since March, when the threat of coronavirus interrupted daily life for millions of Americans. Behnken and Hurley will begin a formal quarantine protocol next week, then spend a few days inside a controlled facility at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston before flying to Kennedy in a NASA aircraft May 20.The astronauts will participate in a final integrated simulation Monday with NASA and SpaceX ground controllers and mission managers.“Then we start a quarantine process which escalates as we get closer to launch,” Hurley said. “And we also get some off time to kind of get everything in our lives sort of squared away since we’ve been busy getting ready for this flight, and we are likely to be in space for a few months.”“We have a few more sims with SpaceX, we’ll have some proficiency sims later on, before we go down to Kennedy,” Hurley said. “And then we’ll get down to Kennedy around six or seven days before launch and then spend the rest of the time (in Florida) prepping from that location in the astronaut crew quarters down there.”SpaceX plans a flight test readiness review May 8, followed by a NASA-led test readiness review May 11.Lueders said Friday that NASA has reviewed SpaceX’s investigation into an engine failure that occurred on a Falcon 9 launch in March. One of the rocket’s nine Merlin engines shut down prematurely during a launch with 60 Starlink Internet satellites, but the rocket overcame the malfunction and still delivered the payloads to their intended orbit.“We’re finishing testing on some other launch vehicle components,” Lueders said. “We have reviewed the anomaly resolution of the Starlink launch and actually have cleared the engines on our vehicle for that failure, so that actually is behind us right now.“But like everybody knows, the spacecraft is still processing, the launch vehicle is still processing, and as you’re processing vehicles there are little issues that come up that we have to work through,” Lueders said. “Most of our human certification activities are being completed with this mission, so the team is going through really about 95 percent of the human-rating certification on this mission.”In mid-May the Dragon spacecraft is expected to be transferred from a processing facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station to the nearby Kennedy Space Center, where the crew capsule will be attached to its Falcon 9 launcher inside a hangar near the southern perimeter of pad 39A.Behnken and Hurley are scheduled to fly to Florida’s Space Coast on May 20.A test-firing of the Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled around May 22, followed the next day by a “dry dress” rehearsal when the astronauts will put on their black and white SpaceX flight suits and strap inside the Crew Dragon spacecraft at the launch pad.A launch readiness review is scheduled for May 25.On May 27, Behnken and Hurley will again put on their flight suits inside the Neil Armstrong Operations and Checkout Building at Kennedy, the same facility where Apollo and shuttle astronauts prepared for launch. They will ride inside a Tesla Model X from the O&C Building to pad 39A, passing by the iconic Vehicle Assembly Building and the Press Site on the way to the seaside launch complex.They will begin boarding the Crew Dragon spaceship around three hours before liftoff. SpaceX’s ground crew will close the Dragon’s side hatch and evacuate the pad before fueling of the Falcon 9 rocket with super-chilled kerosene and liquid oxygen propellants.SpaceX’s sleek crew access arm, installed on pad 39A in 2018, will retract around 42 minutes before liftoff. The Dragon’s powerful abort engines will be armed 37 minutes prior to launch, giving the astronauts the ability to escape an explosion or other emergency during fueling of the Falcon 9 rocket.Kerosene and liquid oxygen will begin flowing into the two-stage launcher 35 minutes before liftoff, which is timed for 4:32 p.m. EDT (2032 GMT) on May 27.Assuming liftoff occurs May 27, the Crew Dragon is slated to autonomous dock with the International Space Station on May 28 at approximately 11:29 a.m. EDT (1529 GMT).Hurley and Behnken will take over manual control of the spaceship at multiple points during the Dragon’s trip to the space station, testing out their ability to fly the capsule using novel touchscreen controls in the cockpit. 
The coronavirus pandemic will be included in future episodes of Coronation Street but will be "handled with a light touch", the soap's producer has said.Iain MacLeod said viewers like the show because it "reflects modern Britain" and so ignoring the pandemic when filming resumes would turn the street into "a parallel fantasy land"."We took the view that it has to exist in our world," he said."However, I am also aware that people tune into Coronation Street for escapism, to some degree, and to see drama and stories that they would never normally experience in their own lives, and stuff they would normally never see in their own living rooms played out on screen."While the virus will exist in Coronation Street, we were also keen that it wouldn't dominate every single story and every single scene."If your lives are anything like mine, certainly coronavirus is pretty much the only topic of conversation in my house, but people wouldn't want to tune into Coronation Street and see every scene was people talking about coronavirus."It will be there. You will be able to see evidence of it in the way people behave - hand-washing protocols and things like that."The way our businesses are run will be tweaked to do more takeaways and the like, as food outlets are doing in the real world."But we will still continue telling the same brilliant, dramatic stories with the healthy dollop of comedy that we always do, because to do otherwise would be, again, to turn the show into something the viewers don't recognise."It will be there. It will be handled with a light touch. Other than that, our storytelling will be business as usual."MacLeod added: "People want to watch drama and they want to watch the same hard-hitting stories that Corrie does so well. They don't want suddenly to be watching a different programme."The ITV show was paused, along with fellow soap Emmerdale, due to the coronavirus pandemic and the social-distancing measures.The channel is running fewer episodes than usual to make the supply last longer.Last week, Sky News revealed how Australian soap Neighbours is working within social-distancing restrictions.The soap seems to be leading the way, with various productions from around the world getting in touch for details on how it is operating, executive producer Jason Herbison said. 
Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump is pulling the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying he wants to go in a "tougher direction" -- a move that came at the urging of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller."We're going in a little different direction. Ron's a good man but we're going in a tougher direction. We want to go in a tougher direction," Trump told reporters Friday at the White House.Miller directly lobbied Trump to pull the nomination, two White House officials told CNN.Miller went to the President and told him that Vitiello, who has led the agency in an acting capacity since last summer, was not fully in favor of closing the southern border, as Trump has threatened to do in recent days.The move to withdraw the nomination came as a surprise to the Department of Homeland Security and members of Congress, sources familiar with the nomination told CNN. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination had been pulled, a person familiar with the news said.Vitiello did not come into the office Friday, according to an ICE official. He had been scheduled to travel with Trump on the President's trip to the US-Mexico border, and was told Thursday he would not be attending.The White House on Thursday evening informed the Senate it was withdrawing its nomination of Vitiello to lead ICE, according to a letter obtained by CNN.ICE leadership was under the impression, even Friday morning, that it was a clerical error, according to someone with knowledge of the nomination process. The agency was anticipating a positive outcome in the next couple of weeks.Trump nominated Vitiello to head the agency in August. He previously served as chief of the US Border Patrol and acting deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection.In a letter sent to agency employees, Vitiello thanked the President, the Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson and members of Congress. "No matter the external circumstances, I am grateful knowing you remain engaged and dedicated to the critical work of protecting our communities from the transnational criminal organizations and cross-border crime that threatens our nation," it reads."While I will not become the permanent director of ICE, I look forward to working alongside you in serving the American public with Integrity, Courage, and Excellence."Vitiello came under scrutiny during his confirmation process as a result of past controversial social media posts. Democratic Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan asked in the hearing about a 2012 tweet, in which Vitiello "suggested that the Democratic Party should be renamed the 'liberalcratic party' or the "Neo-Klanist party.'"Vitiello acknowledged "it was a mistake" and said "he was trying to make a joke," adding that he thought it was a direct message.He also faced criticism from the agency's union, which accused of him making false statements, and at his hearing in November for refusing to rule out potential future family separations, and was questioned about his personal tweets."Never before have we seen so many warning signs with respect to a nominee prior to confirmation and we believe him to be unfit to serve as director," wrote National ICE Council President Chris Crane in a February letter to Senate committee leadership.Still, Vitiello appeared on track to be confirmed. Last month, the Senate Homeland Security Committee voted to move the nomination to a floor vote, after two previous delays on his nomination.Earlier Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee held over his nomination at the Democrats' request.A source close to the White House noted that the President has just needlessly burned political capital with the Republican senators who were in the process of confirming Vitiello."All of this headway that they've made on the Senate side has been completely negated. There are gonna be a number of members on Senate side who are just gonna be beyond pissed off," the source said. "We just burned a ton of political capital."Trump's sudden reversal comes against the backdrop of an increase in apprehensions. CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said late last month that the US was on pace to encounter more than 100,000 migrants in March alone, making it "the highest month since 2008."CBP has been releasing migrants along the southwest border due to detention facilities hitting capacity. ICE has also had to shift resources to assist with the influx.The agency has redirected "countless" resources and personnel in response to the "explosion at the border," said Nathalie Asher, ICE acting executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations in March."Our interior arrests have been affected because I've had to redirect to the priority, as a nation in addressing what has been occurring and continues to occur at an alarming rate at the border," she added.Vitiello is scheduled to testify on ICE before the House Appropriations Homeland Security subcommittee next Wednesday.He recently joined Nielsen on a trip to McAllen, Texas, to meet with sheriffs for a roundtable discussion on border security and strengthening federal-local partnerships.Trump has not named any potential nominees for the ICE post.
In Los Angeles, nothing's quite as hot right now as a tea ceremony.Reporter Emma Carmichael recently partook in a "tea sit" in Topanga Canyon hosted by Baelyn Elspeth, a former model and dancer, and documented her experience for The New York Times. "Tea is a nurturing, beautiful, warming plant, and it can do all kinds of things," Elspeth told Carmichael.Elspeth, age 37, serves tea and holds "ceremonial space" for women, Carmichael wrote. She's one of the first to kick off the trend in "certain and predominantly white wellness circles" in LA, wrote Carmichael, noting that she has amassed nearly 60,000 Instagram followers that include Diplo and Paris Hilton. The ceremony, by Carmichael's account, went something like this: Attendees arrived in comfortable, neutral-colored clothes, as instructed by Elspeth, to "harmonize" with nature; they consumed five or six pots of tea in silence for an hour; and afterwards, they reflected on the ceremony out loud at Elspeth's request.One of the attendees said tea ceremonies are a more "mindful way of spending time together," Carmichael wrote, while Elspeth explained that it helps her connect with nature.Wellness as a status symbolTea ceremonies are just the latest iteration of the wellness craze that has taken off in recent years.Vogue reported in 2015 that health and wellness had become a luxury status symbol, and millennials have been a driving force behind its evolution. They've been dubbed "the wellness generation" by Sanford Health thanks to their increased spending on health and wellness.As a result, a variety of luxury wellness offerings have cropped up to meet this demand, Business Insider's Katie Warren reported. They range from multi-day retreats, like Gwyneth Paltrow's $1,000-per-day wellness summits, to silent meditation retreats, which, Business Insider's Melissa Wiley reported, are one of the fastest-growing trends in travel.Chiva-Som, a celebrity-favorite wellness resort in Thailand, offers wellness itineraries that come in the form of on-site therapists, personal trainers, and wellness practitioners. Even luxury resorts not oriented around wellness are taking a plunge into health: Amanera, a luxury resort by Aman Resorts in the Dominican Republic, recently started offering a "Surf + Sun" program that includes energy treatments, yoga, healthy snacks, and guided meditation.There's also the rise in luxury treatments and services, such as NYC's Clean Market, where monthly packages of cryotherapy can be purchased for $999 a month. Wellness has even made its way into hospitality and real-estate: Hotels are offering amenities such as wellness rooms, while luxury condos and apartments around the US are touting outdoor yoga decks and "tranquility gardens."The wealthy are spending less money on material goods and increasingly on habits and lifestyle choices as a new way to signify their status — and wellness is one area they're choosing to invest in instead.
New York (CNN Business)J.Crew Group, which operates the J.Crew and Madewell brands, has become the first national US retailer to file for bankruptcy protection since the coronavirus pandemic forced a wave of store closures.The clothing retailer said Monday that it has filed to begin Chapter 11 proceedings in federal bankruptcy court in the Eastern District of Virginia. The company also said it had reached a deal with its lenders to convert about $1.65 billion of debt into equity.The retailer expects to stay in business and emerge from bankruptcy as a profitable company. Madewell, the fast-growing denim brand that had been slated for an IPO, will remain part of the business."We will continue all day-to-day operations," J.Crew Group CEO Jan Singer said in a statement.A bankruptcy filing doesn't necessarily mean a company will go out of business. Many firms use bankruptcy to shed debt and other liabilities they can't afford while closing unprofitable operations and locations.But this is a unique time for a retail bankruptcy. Many stores have been closed by quarantines and stay-at-home orders, and some potential shoppers are nervous about venturing out to any stores that are open.Retailers also frequently use store closing sales to liquidate inventory and raise cash they need to fund operations during a bankruptcy reorganization, said Reshmi Basu, an expert in retail bankruptcies at Debtwire, which tracks the finances of troubled companies.J.Crew's bankruptcy filing is the latest sign of the strain the pandemic has placed on retailers. UBS analysts said last month that "retail store closures are likely to accelerate in a post-COVID-19 world," and that the gap between well-positioned retailers and struggling chains will expand because of the outbreak.The group estimated both assets and liabilities at between $1 billion and $10 billion in its bankruptcy filing.J.Crew got its start as a catalog-only retailer in 1983, before opening its first store in New York City in 1989. The company, which is known for its preppy clothes, was purchased by private equity firms TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners in a $3 billion deal that closed in 2011.It has grown rapidly in the nine years since the deal was closed, nearly doubling the number of stores. But it has also accumulated far more debt. It had $50 million of long-term debt on its books in 2010 before the deal was announced. It had $1.7 billion as of Feb. 1.Numerous retailers that have gone out of business in recent years were first purchased by private equity firms that ladled on an unaffordable amount of debt, including Toys "R" Us, Sports Authority, Payless ShoeSource and Gymboree.J.Crew Group had about 14,500 employees as of a year ago, according to the most recent company filing to disclose a head count. About 10,000 of those employees were part-time.The company operates nearly 500 stores, including J.Crew, Madewell and J.Crew factory stores, but outlets have been closed by health concerns surrounding the coronavirus.The widespread store closings due to the coronavirus were not only a sales setback. They also derailed plans to have an initial public offering of the company's more successful Madewell brand, which would have allowed it to pay down debt.Overall company sales increased 2% last year, to $2.5 billion. But there was a wide split between the success of the two brands, as sales at Madewell locations open for at least a year rose 10% last year, while sales fell 1% at the J.Crew branded stores."Madewell was supposed to be the saving grace. This is an asset that lenders were fighting over for years," said Basu. "But no one wants to do an IPO right now, especially a retail IPO. Covid-19 upturned everything."The company posted a $78.8 million net loss during its most recent fiscal year, an improvement from the $120 million loss the year before. Its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes were $250.7 million, more than double the year earlier — $112.8 million — suggesting that the company might have been able to complete its turnaround if plans for a Madewell IPO hadn't been derailed by the virus."As we look to reopen our stores as quickly and safely as possible, this comprehensive financial restructuring should enable our business and brands to thrive for years to come," Singer said on Monday.
In summer 2018, Greta Thunberg started sitting outside the Swedish parliament every Friday to urge leaders to take action on climate change. A little over a year later, the 16-year-old environmental activist led the largest global climate strike in history, which involved an estimated 4 million people across 161 countries. Time magazine just named her the 2019 person of the year.In a video interview with Time, Thunberg said she tries to say no to meetings with politicians when she can."It's just small talk, basically," Thunberg said. "And, of course, they want to take selfies."She sighed, adding: "I'm a bit tired of selfies right now."'I try to say no to meeting with politicians'The long list of celebrities and politicians who have met with Thunberg includes Pope Francis, former President Barack Obama, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.She has ridden bikes with former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and hung out with the actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio.Thunberg has also addressed elected officials in the US Congress, UK Parliament, and French National Assembly. In September, she gave world leaders at the United Nations Climate Action Summit an impassioned, tearful speech."You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words," she said.Thunberg is in Madrid at the COP25 climate summit.But she told The Associated Press that most politicians "say they listen and they say they understand, but it sure doesn't seem like it.""The real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done, apart from clever accounting and creative PR," she told AP, adding, "if they really would listen and understand, then I think they need to prove that by translating that into action."Meeting Trump 'would be a waste of time, really'During her fall visit to the US, Thunberg appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show," and DeGeneres asked if Thunberg would consider sitting down with President Donald Trump to "try to help him understand climate change."Thunberg responded: "I don't understand why I would do that. I don't see what I could tell him that he hasn't already heard, and I just think it would be a waste of time, really."Trump, who has in the past called climate change a Chinese hoax, has initiated the process of pulling the US out of the Paris climate agreement. His administration has also catalyzed rollbacks on a variety of environmental policies, including the US Endangered Species Act and the Environmental Protection Agency's clean-water regulations.While they haven't met, Trump and Thunberg did spar on Twitter.After her fiery speech at the UN, Trump mockingly tweeted: "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"Thunberg promptly changed her Twitter bio to: "A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future."
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May’s government is ready to hold more discussions with the opposition Labour party this weekend over Brexit, a spokesman for May’s office said on Friday.“We have made serious proposals in talks this week and are prepared to pursue changes to the Political Declaration in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides,” he added in a statement.“We are ready to hold further detailed discussions this weekend in order to seek any such changes in the run-up to European Council on Wednesday. The government is determined to work constructively to deliver the Brexit people voted for, and avoid participation in the European Parliamentary elections.”
Some Texas businesses, including restaurants, malls and movie theaters, began to reopen Friday in response to Governor Greg Abbott's decision to let the state's stay-at-home order expire. Major theater chains have remained closed, but some smaller theaters have chosen to reopen — with heightened security measures in place. EVO Entertainment CEO Mitchell Roberts told Variety that it plans to reopen two of its theaters with "airport security-style check-in" on Monday. He said the company's "focus is on earning that customer confidence back."The open EVO theaters will allow guests to enter through a cordoned area and will be asked if anyone in their household has had flu symptoms in the last two weeks, Roberts told Variety. Guests will also be subject to an infrared temperature screening, and anyone with a temperature over 100.4 degrees will be turned away.Under an executive order signed by Abbott on April 28, businesses are encouraged to follow the "minimum standard health protocols" recommended by Texas' Health Department, including social distancing. "Individuals are encouraged to wear appropriate face coverings, but no jurisdiction can impose a civil or criminal penalty for failure to wear a face covering," the order reads. Texas theaters are allowed to "operate at up to 25 percent of the total listed occupancy of any individual theater for any screening," according to Abbott's order. If the state sees two weeks of data without any COVID-19 flare-ups, businesses will be allowed to increase that capacity to 50%. New data from Austin research firm Kickstand Communications shows that, while people may return to stores, the same may not be true of movie theaters, CBS Austin reports. According to Kickstand, 15% of Austin residents said they plan to immediately return to shopping at standalone retail stores, and 87% said they'll return within the month. But only 10% said they would immediately return to movie theaters and malls, and just over 60% of Austinites said they are planning to go back within the month.Santikos Entertainment, a movie theater chain based in San Antonio, has reopened three of its nine locations at 25% capacity, Variety reports."We do not take these responsibilities lightly," the company's CEO said in a message posted to its website. "We have been working diligently on safety protocols that will make Santikos a model, not just for theaters, but for all businesses on how to open responsibly."Like EVO, Santikos said it will also ask all customers if they — or anyone they have been in close contact with — has experienced any COVID-19 symptoms within the past 14 days. "If yes, you will not be allowed in the theater and we will reimburse you your ticket," according to the new guidelines. Both companies are offering discounted $5 tickets during the reopening period, spaced seating, and have reconfigured their concessions to reduce person to person contact. "We are confident these daily procedures will provide a safe and enjoyable environment that will allow our community to escape this dreadful reality we've been living in," said Santikos' CEO. As Texas relaxes its regulations, the state has 1,725 people in the hospital due to COVID-19, and 30,522 cases reported, according to the state's Department of Health. Of the 847 deaths reported statewide as of Saturday, 51 were in Austin's Travis County, and 48 in San Antonio's Bexar County. Data suggests the state is doing less than half of its ideal projection of testing 40,000 people a day, despite having over 250 testing sites across the state. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins told CBS News' Omar Villafranca that his area needs "about four times as much testing" as they currently have before returning to business."Texas — it fights each day to be either dead last or next to last on the amount of testing," Jenkins said. "To open up, you need to see [the number of cases] go down for two weeks."
One-third of surveyed workers said they had talked about sexual misconduct at work over the past year, and a third of US employees said they had changed their office behavior in the wake of the #MeToo movement.A little more than three in 10 surveyed men, however, viewed the #MeToo movement unfavorably. An earlier survey found 60% of male supervisors felt more afraid to have one-on-one meetings with female employees after the movement."No woman should have to experience this sort of harassment at work. Ms. McILraith is standing up," her attorney, Zoe Salzman of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff & Abady LLP, told the New York Post. "Other women are standing up. And more will follow."

The second meteor shower in as many weeks will dazzle the eyes of stargazers around the globe, but the light show will be battling against the glow of a nearly full moon when it reaches its peak.The Eta Aquarids is an annual meteor shower in early May, and this year, reaches its climax on Monday night and the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday morning."This shower happens to be one of if not the best in the Southern Hemisphere," AccuWeather Astronomy Blogger Dave Samuhel said. "It is a moderate shower for the Northern Hemisphere."People living south of the equator may count as many as 40 shooting stars per hour at the height of the celestial light show, the American Meteor Society (AMS) said. This includes Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America."From the equator northward, they usually only produce medium rates of 10-30 per hour just before dawn," the AMS added.This year, the meteor shower will be peaking just two nights before the final supermoon of 2020. The bright moon may make it difficult to see some of the fainter meteors, but it should not completely wash out the shower.Of course, weather and cloud cover will significantly factor into how well sky gazers in different parts of the country are able to witness the meteor shower.Onlookers across the southern U.S. and the interior West are forecast to have the best viewing contains for 2020's iteration of the Eta Aquarids. Mainly clear conditions are also on tap for parts of New England and into Quebec.A storm gathering over the central U.S. will spread disruptive clouds over much of the Midwest and into parts of Appalachia, obscuring the night sky.Clouds could also spoil the meteor shower over the Pacific Northwest as a storm moves into the region.The Eta Aquarids will be active on the nights leading up to and immediately following the peak, so people that have cloudy weather on Monday night may be able to spot some shooting stars later in the week when the clouds clear.No special equipment is needed to watch a meteor shower, although people should pack some patience when heading out to spend some time under the stars."Give yourself a solid hour to look for meteors. Get comfortable. Lay down on a blanket, or you a reclining chair," Samuhel said.People should also avoid looking toward the moon, which will be above the horizon for most of the night. Looking at the moon can make it harder to see meteors, so try to focus in the darkest part of the sky.The best time to watch the meteor shower will be after midnight once the shower's radiant point climbs above the horizon.The radiant point is simply the part of the sky where the meteors originate, but you do not need to look in this direction so spot meteors. However, as the radiant point climbs higher in the sky, more and more meteors will able to be seen.Many of the meteor showers throughout the year are caused by debris left behind by comets when they visit the inner solar system. When this debris enters the Earth's atmosphere, it burns incredibly bright for a few brief seconds."The majority of visible meteors are caused by particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams," the AMS said.The debris that causes the Eta Aquarids is actually dust left behind by one of the most famous comets - Halley's Comet.Halley's Comet only orbits the sun once every 75 years, but each year in early May, the Earth passes through some of the debris that it left behind."The Eta Aquarids are one of two meteor showers sparked by Halley's comet. The other being the Orionids in October. "People that miss out on the Eta Aquarids will need to wait a few months before the next opportunity to catch a meteor shower.According to the AMS, the next major meteor shower will not peak until late July.
Countries across the Asia-Pacific region have announced plans to cautiously reopen for business as governments around the world race to reboot economies devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.Hong Kong, South Korea and Australia have all vowed to get their residents back to school and work in the coming days as Covid-19 infection rates slow. Financial markets have become caught between concern about cratering economies and rising US-China tension, and the prospect of more countries reopening for business.On Tuesday, Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, announced plans to reopen schools, cinemas, bars and beauty parlours from Friday, with authorities set to hand out reusable face masks to all 7.5 million residents. Hong Kong has had 1,041 cases of coronavirus with four deaths.The move comes after the territory’s economy, already damaged by months of protest before the coronavirus outbreak, recorded its worst decline on record. GDP shrunk 8.9% year-on-year in the first quarter, the deepest contraction since records began in 1974, and the fourth consecutive quarter to drop. Lam noted it was worse than that experienced during the Asian financial crisis in 1998.In South Korea, once the worst-hit country outside China, the government relaxed social distancing rules on Wednesday and students will return to school from Monday. The country, with more than 10,800 cases and 255 deaths, has been held up as an example of how to contain the virus. On Wednesday the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported two new cases – both imported – as the number of new infections continued to slow.The education minister, Yoo Eun-hae, said high school seniors, who are preparing for highly competitive university entrance exams, would return to schools on 13 May with younger students to follow in phases from 20 May.Students and teachers will have to wear a mask except during mealtimes, wipe their desks and observe social distancing as they move around. Schools will also be required to regularly disinfect their premises, conduct temperature checks and rearrange seating.The South Korean professional baseball season began on Tuesday, although teams played in empty stadiums, and football is to follow suit on Friday.Thailand, which has seen 2,987 cases and 54 deaths, began easing restrictions on movement and gatherings on Monday, allowing restaurants, hair salons and open-air markets to resume business, provided that social distancing is maintained and proprietors carry out temperature checks. In neighbouring Vietnam, which has had 271 cases and no deaths, life is also gradually returning to normal, but the economy, which relies on tourism for a 6% of its GDP, faces huge challenges.The Australian government on Wednesday said it was seeking ways to reopen locked down businesses as early as July, as its success in containing the coronavirus outbreak allows it to focus on trying to regain a million jobs lost since mid-March.Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and state leaders will discuss health protocols at a national cabinet meeting on Friday that could enable businesses to open in a “Covid-safe environment”, with the government saying the shutdown has been costing the economy A$4bn a week.“The lesson from history … is that the quicker you can get people back into jobs and off those unemployment queues, the better off the economy will be and the better off those individuals will be,” the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told ABC television.There would be three stages to easing restrictions on social distancing for affected industries, with cafes, restaurants and retail expected to be among the first to be allowed to reopen. Each state would move at its own pace with the common goal of having most of their economies rebooted by July. Australia has had fewer than 7,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and there are fewer than 1,000 active cases remaining. Ninety-six people have died in the outbreak.The resumption of business might also coincide with the opening of the border between Australia and New Zealand, creating what has been dubbed a trans-Tasman “travel bubble”, given that both countries have significantly reduced infection levels and rates.In the US, the Trump administration is also pushing for an end to lockdowns to focus on economic growth, despite the nation leading the world in infections and deaths, and experts warning that the worst is yet to come. President Donald Trump has scrapped daily coronavirus task force briefings and marginalised his medical experts, preferring economic officials to publicly urge states to reopen.Chinese stock indices reopened in positive territory on Wednesday after the spring holiday but the Australian market lost 0.6% and futures trading pointed to a similar drop in London and New York later in the day. Disney cast a pall over Wall Street by announcing losses of $1.4bn in the first quarter and the entertainment company still had no indication when it might reopen its profitable theme parks in Europe and the US. Airbnb, the home booking site, said it was cutting 1,900 jobs amid the worldwide travel slump.In other coronavirus developments:Britain has overtaken Italy to become the worst-hit nation in Europe, and the second-worst in the world, with more than 32,000 deaths.Youth unemployment in Britain will reach 1 million people over the coming year unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education, a thinktank warns.The global lockdown caused by Covid-19 risks a “devastating” surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths by 2025, new research shows.Brazil confirmed its highest daily coronavirus deaths on Tuesday. There were 6,935 new cases since Monday evening and 600 new deaths. The previous record of 474 deaths came on 28 April.Mexico’s president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, signalled some automotive factories could open in coming weeks.After two consecutive days of zero new coronavirus cases, on Wednesday New Zealand reported one new case of the virus and one more death. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said success in curbing Covid-19 had provided a “safe haven” advantage allowing the country to be open for investment. 
Mr Gove said the public had shown “amazing stoicism and understanding” about changes imposed to deal with the killer disease. Speaking in Downing Street, he said the country was facing a “new normal” that would mean staggered use of public transport and other measures as the government takes a cautious approach to change the rules.Ultimately, unless and until we have a new vaccine, I suspect we are going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus.”Official figures yesterday showed 28,446 people with coronavirus have now died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community, up by 315 on the day before.Around 76,500 tests had been produced in the latest daily round.Changes will be made to lockdown in stages to allow the experts to monitor the impact carefully of lifting measures.Mr Gove said: “A phased approach is one which allows us to monitor the impact that those changes are having on public health and if necessary, in a specific and localised way, that means we can pause or even reintroduce those restrictions that might be required in order to deal with localised outbreaks of the disease.” 
Launch provider Rocket Lab  has opened the doors on LC-2, its first launch facility in the U.S., adding capacity and versatility for providing trips to orbit. And LC-2 already has its first customer: the U.S. Air Force’s Space Test Program.The company had a little shindig today at the facility, located on Wallops Island in Virginia — home to NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, as well. There they took the wrapper off LC-2, which has been under construction since it was announced last October.It’s not some wild new concept, just a typical launchpad and support facilities where the rockets live, get checked, fueled and so on. The most important difference with this one, for Rocket Lab, is that it’s here in the U.S. — so far, all its 10 commercial launches have been from Launch Complex 1 in New Zealand, where the company is based.The new facility will be put to use soon: the Air Force is first in line to put a payload into orbit in a launch currently planned for Q2 of 2020. All we know about the mission, STP-27RM, is that it will “test new capabilities that we will need in the future.”“It’s an honor and privilege to be launching a U.S. Air Force’s Space Test Program payload as the inaugural mission from Launch Complex 2,” said Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck in a press release. “We’ve already successfully delivered STP payloads on Electron from Launch Complex 1, and we’re proud to be providing that same rapid, responsive, and tailored access to orbit from U.S. soil.”Right now LC-2 is “only” equipped to handle up to 12 launches a year, while LC-1 can theoretically do 120. Rocket Lab is nowhere near hitting those rates just yet, but they’re well on their way with a perfect track record and a demonstration of its ability to quickly adjust time frames. The goal is eventually to be launching weekly, or even more frequently than that. And the more launch sites they have to pull that off, the better.
H. G. WELLS once wrote, “Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race.” The bicycle is possibly the most efficient form of transportation ever devised. If one converts calories to gasoline, a bicycle gets 1,000 mpg—the average American car, 25.In terms of traveling green the difference between renting a car and riding is profound. According to the EPA, carbon dioxide accounts for 95 to 99 percent of automobile-generated global warming emissions; a typical rental car spews out almost one pound of CO2 per mile. In New York City, if just one out of 20 people switched from taxis and private cars to bicycles and public transportation, it would save 150 million pounds of CO2 emissions a year, the equivalent of planting a forest 1.3 times the size of Manhattan island.The efficiency of cycling extends to time. Pedaling around a city with dedicated bike lanes (such as New York City, where a three-day bike-share pass costs a mere $24) often takes less time than commuting by taxi, bus, or subway. The average American commuter spends 42 hours a year stuck in traffic. So why aren’t more Americans bicycling, especially when they visit cities? In fact, they are. In the past decade the number of people riding bikes has doubled. More than 100 million Americans rode a bike in 2014, and 45 million used their bicycle for transportation. Hundreds of cities across the United States, D.C. to Denver, Salt Lake City to San Diego, Austin to Atlanta, are building bike paths.New York City has added 54 miles of bike lanes every year since 2007; Chicago has added 27 miles of bike ways annually since 2011. Some 70 percent of American mayors would prefer more bike paths than more car lanes or parking lots. In 2015 Minneapolis became the first American city to be listed among the world’s top bike-friendly communities. Its Midtown Greenway, a 5.5-mile bicycle path, once a railroad corridor, is open 24/7, lit at night, and plowed during the winter. It has thousands of daily users. In 2014 Atlanta won a prestigious environmental rehabilitation award for its revitalization of the Beltline, a 33-mile greenway (also once a railroad track) specifically for bicycling and walking. (Check out this new bike path that connects eight European cities.)Dockless bike-share pioneers such as Spin and Jump have been brightening cities for years with their colorful bike frames (although some bike-share companies are now shifting gears in favor of electric scooters). Most dockless rentals cost about $1 for 30 minutes. Riders download an app, locate a nearby bike, and use their smartphones to unlock and pay for their ride, parking the bike at their final destination rather than docking at a permanent station.Dozens of cities around the world have adopted bike-share programs or have established dedicated bike lanes. Here are five cities perfect for exploring by bike because of their well-managed infrastructure (designated bike lanes, roadside rentals, international airport access), sense of biker-friendliness (from both drivers and pedestrians), and visual appeal (easy to look at and get around).MontrealWith more than a thousand miles of bike paths it’s easy to get around Canada’s mostly flat second-largest city. For North Americans, the French language, cuisine, and architecture make Montreal feel like the quickest escape to Europe. Trip tip: Pedal along the Lachine Canal for an excellent view of the skyline.LjubljanaRich in Renaissance and baroque art and architecture, the capital of Slovenia is one of the world’s best cities to see on bike. Not only does it offer more than 150 miles of bike lanes, Ljubljana’s city center is wonderfully flat and compact; some portions do not allow cars and are open only to pedestrians, cyclists, and a few electric taxis.

It may have been quite the decade for the U.S. exchange-traded fund market, but the next one could see its assets surge tenfold to $50 trillion, Bank of America predicted.“The current growth rate points to ETF assets approaching $50tn over the next decade driven by a continued move to passive and increased awareness of the attractive tax efficiency, cost, liquidity and transparency characteristics of ETFs,” Mary Ann Bartels, investment and ETF strategist at Bank of America, said in a note Thursday.Money has flooded into ETFs during this record-long bull market, while active strategies have suffered. Since the inception of the first ETF — the S&P 500 SPDR — in 1993, the U.S. market has grown rapidly to a $4.3 trillion juggernaut. Equity passive funds alone, which include index funds, have ballooned to a more than $3 trillion market in less than 10 years, according to Morningstar.Total ETF assets have been growing at a “fairly consistent” annual rate of 25% from $770 billion 10 years ago, Bank of America said, adding the market could hit $5.3 trillion by the end of 2020 at this rate.That rate will accelerate beyond as the industry innovates even more and swallows up more assets in places like fixed income, the firm predicts.Bank of America believes the relatively strong stock market will keep investors in the passive space. The bank expects the S&P 500 to rise 5% next year and sees interest rate remaining stable.“This positive fundamental backdrop is likely to be supportive to net asset values as well as continued inflows of new assets,” Bartels said.
Coronavirus deaths in care homes are not inevitable, a report has warned amid fears the killer virus has claimed the lives of thousands of Britain's most vulnerable. Researchers at the London School of Economics have highlighted exactly where the UK has fallen short of protecting some 400,000 care home residents and staff. More than 5,000 care home residents have died from COVID-19. Official data shows care home deaths account for more than a third of all fatalities. The LSE report highlights how the UK Government's response has been different to other countries, taking a reactive approach rather than precautionary measures to prevent an outbreak.  In contrast, Hong Kong - which took action to prevent a crisis early on - has recorded no official deaths in care homes.In some cases, swab tests have been limited to six residents with symptoms per care home, forcing staff to make assumptions on who may have the killer infection.Carers are allowed to continue working even if they have had contact with a positive case, while in Germany a 14-day self isolation period is compulsory. In South Korea, where total and care home deaths have been relatively low, regular temperature checks are taken of residents. A fever is one of the tell-tale symptoms. Similarly in Hong Kong, residents are self-isolating even if there is no outbreak and must wear a face mask if they leave their room.   Adelina Comas-Herrera, an author of the report, said she expects the UK number of deaths of care home residents to amount to half of all deaths, as is happening in France, Belgium and Canada. The pattern has been reported in Spain and Italy - where governments were slow to act and were underprepared for the pandemic with low levels of PPE - but the data is not as reliable.Ms Comas-Herrera, an assistant professorial research fellow in the Department of Health Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, has been gathering resources worldwide to create LTCcovid.LTCcovid (Long-Term Care responses to COVID-19) will document the impact of COVID-19 in care settings over the course of the pandemic.Its most recent report said: 'While it is early to come to firm conclusions and there are many difficulties with data, these differences suggest that having large numbers of deaths as result of COVID-19 is not inevitable and that appropriate measures to prevent and control infections in care homes can save lives.' LTCcovid collection of information finds that countries that appear to have had relative success in preventing COVID-19 entering care homes have very strict processes to isolate and test all care home residents and staff.They don't just focus on those who have symptoms, but anyone who may have had contact with people who have tested positive for COVID-19. At least in the UK, timely and systematic testing of care home residents and staff has been lacking. It has come to light that testing was initially done on the first five symptomatic residents, meaning potentially several more would have gone untested. Testing capacity has been and is still very limited since the start, so priorities lie with people in hospitals and NHS workers. Care homes have to decide who to isolate based on assumptions of who has the illness, leaving others to mingle with each other while following social distancing rules. But 'there is also growing evidence of asymptomatic transmission in care homes, which highlights the importance of regular testing in care homes instead of relying on symptoms to identify people with potential COVID-19 infections', Ms Comas-Herreras writes.'Geriatricians are also raising concerns that, among care home residents, the symptoms of COVID-19 may not be the typical cough and fever that is covered in the guidance documents for care homes in many countries, but that a range of other symptoms (such as delirium, diarrhoea, lethargy, falls and reduced appetite) are more frequent among care home residents with COVID-19.'Current guidelines in the UK only require the isolation of residents and staff who are symptomatic. Similar guidelines were in place in Spain until the 24th of March.But the World Health Organization's guidelines insist on isolation of residents and staff who are suspected to have COVID-19. The Government has been slated for its lack of support to nursing homes, with no routine testing available, no up-to-date records of the number of people infected or dead, and 'paltry' attempts to deliver adequate protective clothing for staff. The South Korean approach has been robust, albeit potentially distressing for care home residents.Any resident that displays symptoms of COVID-19 enter quarantine facilities such as the Human Resources Development Institute and the English Learning Campus, both in Seoul. Care workers clean their room and the resident can only return once they have tested negative after a two-week isolation period. Authorities acted fast to prevent outbreaks if there were a spike in cases in the community.In Gyungsang-do, the region with the second highest recorded rate of COVID-19 cases in South Korea, 564 care homes were quarantined to prevent the virus entering the home, local media report.Staff were stopped from leaving the facility for two weeks with financial incentives to keep them going.   Ms Comas-Herrera said Germany was 'an outlier' in Europe owing to its proactive stance on testing and stricter guidelines on discharging elderly patients from hospital, The Times reports.   States across Germany have reacted differently to control infection in care homes, with measures ranging from quarantining COVID-19 patients at separate facilities to compulsory wearing of face masks by staff when entering residents' rooms. Meanwhile the Italian government acted late on the COVID-19 outbreak management in nursing homes, restricting visitations after the lockdown when thousands were already infected in the population.  It's difficult to compare death rates of COVID-19 in care homes because there are differences in how deaths are recorded, how data is published and testing. There have been large numbers of deaths in care homes in Italy, Spain, the UK and the US but official data for these countries is either incomplete or difficult to interpret, LSE say. The percentage of COVID-related deaths - suspected or confirmed - among care home residents ranges from 19 per cent in the UK to 62 per cent in Canada, where care homes have been hard hit. The lower total deaths a country has, the lower the care home deaths tends to be.  For example in Singapore, two per cent of its 18 deaths have been in care homes.There have been no infections or deaths in care homes in Hong Kong - only four deaths in total and 1,040 cases of infections in the total population.  Singapore, where there are 18,700 cases, there has been relative success at preventing infection from reaching care homes, LTC Covid report.Data for Germany suggests that 36 per cent of deaths would have happened in communal establishments. This includes care homes, prisons and other group living settings. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) provides weekly updates of deaths registered in England and Wales. But there is a delay in reporting because the ONS figures are slower to prepare. They have to be certified by a doctor, registered and processed. The most recent report said there were 22,351 deaths registered in England and Wales involving COVID-19 up until April 17.Three quarters (75 per cent) occurred in hospitals, 19 per cent (4,168) in care homes and five per cent (1,083) in private homes.  Deaths in the week April 11-17 were double the five year average, according to an ONS analysis showed.  National Records of Scotland (NRS) publishes a weekly analysis of death registrations which mention COVID-19 on the death certificate.Of the 2,272 deaths that occurred in all settings up until April 26, 886 COVID-19 deaths occurred in care homes - a rate of 39 per cent.  Thousands of care home deaths are reported weeks after they occur, according to ONS data. Experts fear that because of this, the sheer scale of the problem in UK homes is misunderstood. Ms Comas-Herrera said it is currently complicated to understand how many COVID-19 deaths have occurred among care home residents because they might also be included in hospital death data, if that is where they died.But Ms Comas-Herrera said she expects the UK will see care home deaths reach 50 per cent, similar to France where official data records 51 per cent, and Canada. Although it seems we have reached a peak in hospital deaths, she is not sure whether we have reached the peak in care homes deaths. Her thoughts echo other experts. Last week, Sir David Spiegelhalter, a highly regarded statistics expert and an OBE recipient, said he believes the numbers of care home deaths are still climbing as Government statistics show hospital fatalities are trailing off.He spoke of a 'massive, unprecedented spikes' in the number of people dying in nursing homes.Care Quality Commission (CQC) reports suggest care homes are now seeing around 400 coronavirus deaths each day, on average - a number on par with hospitals in England.Government ministers, pressured on claims they didn't do enough to help care homes, insist they were 'not overlooked' while they scrambled to protect the NHS from collapsing.   While warnings about hospitals sparked a 'protect the NHS' mantra and a rush to buy ventilators and free up beds, nursing homes saw no such efforts. Britain's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, revealed he and other senior scientists warned politicians 'very early on' about the risk COVID-19 posed to care homes.The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) has been meeting approximately twice a week since its first coronavirus discussion on January 22.Sir Patrick, who chairs the group along with Professor Chris Whitty, said they had 'flagged' the risk of care home and hospital outbreaks at the start of the epidemic. Environment Secretary George Eustice said on April 29 'we have always recognised there was more vulnerability there'. He denied that more testing would have saved lives. The number of residents dying of any cause has almost tripled in a month, from around 2,500 per week in March to 7,300 in a single week in April - more than 2,000 of the latter were confirmed COVID-19 cases. 
(Reuters) - U.S. trade negotiators have offered to cancel a new round of tariffs on imported Chinese goods set to take effect on Sunday as part of an effort to cement a phase-one deal to de-escalate the trade relationship between the two powers, the Wall Street Journal said on Thursday.Citing people briefed on matter, the Journal also said Trump administration negotiators have offered to cut existing tariffs by as much as half on roughly $360 billion of Chinese-made goods.
A WIDE-ranging post-Brexit trade deal with the US has the power to accelerate the UK's recovery from the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the Federation of Small Businesses has predicted, with almost half of all small firms seeing America as the most important trading partner.Mike Cherry, FSB chairman, said he was hoping small businesses would be placed at the centre of any future deal, given the crucial importance of US markets.He said: "For small businesses, the US is the number one single market of choice for importers and exporters for the next three years, which is why these negotiations are so critical.“Exporting will be crucial for many small businesses to support their recovery from the pandemic and that is why it’s crucial to see a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers."The coronavirus pandemic is costing UK businesses an estimated £2.5 billion a day, with uncertainty about what the future holds, Mr Cherry acknowledged.However, he added: "With our economy likely to be suppressed for some time, we are going to need small businesses that trade to lead the way."The prospects of a trade-led recovery would be lifted by progress in trade negotiations with the EU as our nearest trading bloc, the US as the largest global economy, as well as other nations already bouncing back after COVID-19 such as China."However, he singled out the US as key, saying: "Our own findings suggest that the US is the most important individual country market for small firms hoping to export over the next three years, with 46 percent selecting the country.“Small businesses are already the backbone of the UK’s domestic economy."And especially in these difficult times, we now need to see their share of global trade start to catch up."We can do this by putting SMEs front and centre of all new trade agreements.“Securing a pro-small business free trade agreement, which includes a comprehensive and dedicated small business chapter, will be essential to addressing the needs and distinct challenges that small firms face when engaged in transatlantic trade."Mr Lighthizer acknowledged the impact of COVID-19, and the importance of the ongoing discussions, on Tuesday, saying: "While this is at first a health crisis, each of us is also facing an economic crisis perhaps like never before."But we need to prepare now for the day when the health crisis recedes and lay the foundations for stronger, more resilient economies."This crisis has demonstrated how important it is to have strong and diverse supply chains with trusted trade partners to support our economies."It has shown that we need to have a healthy manufacturing base and workers and farmers that are thriving."It has shown that depending purely on cheap imports for strategic products can make us vulnerable in times of crisis."Moreover, it has confirmed that we need to think carefully about our trade policies and how we work with our trading partners."Ms Truss said: “The US is our largest trading partner and increasing transatlantic trade can help our economies bounce back from the economic challenge posed by coronavirus.“We want to strike an ambitious deal that opens up new opportunities for our businesses, brings in more investment and creates better jobs for people across the whole of the country.“As the Prime Minister has said, the UK is a champion of free trade and this deal will make it even easier to do business with our friends across the pond.” 
Less than a day after newly emboldened Democratic lawmakers announced bills that would significantly tighten tenant protections, prominent real estate developers got Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on the phone to make a last-ditch plea to persuade him to block the measures.The developers, including Douglas Durst, Richard LeFrak and William C. Rudin, are involved with some of the most iconic buildings on the New York City skyline, including One World Trade Center and 3 Times Square, and have long wielded major influence in Albany.They and their counterparts in the real estate industry have donated millions of dollars in campaign contributions to Mr. Cuomo and other state politicians in recent decades.But on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo rebuffed the developers, telling them that “they should call their legislators if they want to do something about it,” said a person briefed on the call, which lasted about 15 minutes.The phone call capped a humiliating moment for an industry that had long reigned in the state capital.“I’m in shock. I think many of us in my industry are in shock,” said James R. Wacht, president of the firm Lee & Associates and a board member of Real Estate Board of New York, the industry’s leading trade group. “It’s a lot worse than we anticipated.”The bills announced on Tuesday night by the Democratic leaders of the State Senate and the Assembly would abolish rules that let building owners deregulate apartments and close loopholes that permit them to raise rents.The legislation would directly impact almost one million rent-regulated apartments in New York City, which account for more than 40 percent of the city’s rental stock, and allow other municipalities statewide beyond New York City and its suburbs to adopt their own regulations.[Read more about how the new rent regulations in New York would affect tenants and landlords]Real estate industry groups said the bills would do serious damage to housing in the city by reducing incentives for landlords to renovate existing apartments and to build affordable new ones.Existing rent laws expire on Saturday. The rent regulation package, which is expected to be approved before the end of the week, is perhaps the most resonant symbol of the change in power in Albany since Democrats took complete control in November.Republicans had dominated the State Senate for most of the last century and formed a close alliance with the New York City real estate industry, which donated heavily to Republican senators.The elections in November not only brought Democrats to power in the State Senate, but also saw the rise of progressive lawmakers who fiercely opposed real estate interests.“There was some arrogance on the part of the real estate industry that was based on how things have functioned in Albany for a long time,” said State Senator Zellnor Myrie, a Brooklyn Democrat who is a member of the new cohort of progressives. “In the past there was no need for them to truly engage the way that I think would have been necessary this time around.”Lawmakers, government aides and lobbyists said in interviews on Wednesday that the industry had pinned its hopes on Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who at times tried to act as a brake on his party’s left wing.But in the last week of negotiations, Mr. Cuomo distanced himself from the debate. He dismissed requests from the real estate lobby to engage in negotiations with Democratic leaders of the Senate and Assembly, inviting the Legislature instead to pass bills on its own.When real estate lobbyists called the governor’s office over the last week, they were told by the governor’s aides that Mr. Cuomo had stepped back and that they should speak with legislators instead.“There is no negotiation,” Mr. Cuomo said on Tuesday before the deal was announced. “I will sign the best bill they can pass.”Asked on Wednesday whether he had changed his mind, Mr. Cuomo said, “I believe this is the best tenant protections they will pass.”The developers who reached Mr. Cuomo on the phone on Wednesday declined to comment.But one person briefed on the call said the developers expressed surprise at the way the governor had handled the rent issue, and voiced concern about the impact the legislation would have on the construction of new housing.Several people on the call raised the possibility of legal challenges. Mr. Cuomo had no reaction to that, according to the person briefed on the call.Mr. Cuomo’s spokeswoman, Dani Lever, said, “The governor and staff had a call with real estate and housing people who were concerned that the bill could reduce the number of units in New York. And he said they should raise those concerns to the Legislature.”The industry had already tried that, having met with lawmakers in Albany over the past few months, presenting them with sophisticated charts that purported to show how the proposed measures would erode the city’s housing stock.The industry also commissioned an expensive advertising campaign featuring construction workers who were depicted warning that they could lose their jobs under the new proposals.After the announcement on Tuesday night, industry officials scrambled to figure out what had gone wrong, blaming a combination of strategic miscalculations, resurgent activism by the progressive left and a new mood of antipathy — in New York and nationally — toward landlords and the wealthy.And industry leaders seem to have been slow to adapt to the new environment.From 2010 until last month, a prominent landlord group, the Rent Stabilization Association, donated more than $800,000 to the campaign committee for State Senate Republicans. In the same time period, the group spent just $25,000 on State Senate Democrats.The Real Estate Board of New York similarly favored Republicans. Last year, it spent more than $1 million on independent campaign expenditures, mostly to back two Republican politicians running for the State Senate — one on Long Island and one in the suburbs north of New York City. Both candidates lost.This year, as the tenant activists’ platform gained traction, landlords did not publicize their own counterproposals, fearful of losing leverage by offering compromises. Instead, industry members relied on their traditional method of private negotiations, trying to talk key lawmakers out of the more dramatic changes in one-on-one meetings.“The industry held their cards close to the vest, thinking that the consequences of these proposals would be obvious to everyone,” Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, said.In the hours since the deal was announced, industry officials have blitzed lawmakers with phone calls in an attempt to contain the damage. They have pored over the bill to single out the most far-reaching provisions, then relayed them to senators from moderate districts, hoping to convince them to vote against the bill.“The governor and Legislature have a choice,” John H. Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said in a statement. “They can work collaboratively to change the legislation and pass responsible reforms or pass the bill and worsen the city’s housing crisis.”Some of the lawmakers seemed to be receptive. Senator James Gaughran, a newly elected Democrat from Long Island, said he was reviewing the bill. “I’m just a little concerned about the unintended consequences of some of this,” he said on Wednesday.Still, some industry leaders suggested that the governor had failed them.“We thought the governor would help moderate some of the more ridiculous proposals,” said Jay Martin, the executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade association representing about 4,000 building owners. “That did not happen.”“It seems to be that the democratic socialist wing of the Democratic Party is in full control of the state government,” Mr. Martin added. “I think this is the official declaration of that.”For tenant activists, the shift of power was a moment years in the making.“We’re seeing a sea change,” said Jonathan Westin, executive director of New York Communities for Change, an advocacy group that pushed for stronger tenant protections. “Real estate dominated for so long that what we’re seeing is a much broader and more aggressive movement to go out and win on these issues.” 
KERN COUNTY, Calif. (FOX26) — Kern County's stay-at-home order is now lifted. However, the area still falls under the State's shelter-in-place order, which overrides the local ruling.This comes as Kern County closes in on 1000 coronavirus cases.The Kern County County Health Officer said Saturday the local order was meant to serve as a show of support for the statewide order.Governor Gavin Newsom said Friday that he was "days, not weeks" away from adjusting the statewide order.Kern County says its decision to lift its order is in anticipation of the transition to a re-opened economy."We want the county to be positioned so we can quickly maximize our local response and clear the way for the changes ahead," Kern County Public Health explained.The Kern County Board of Supervisors has also created an ad-hoc committee that will review and interpret the statewide list of essential businesses, then make recommendations for how the County should proceed in opening and operating those businesses.The County Health Department explained, this is all in an effort to expedite the re-opening process."We continue to ask the community to adhere to the Governor’s order to stay at home and practice social distancing. These actions have been determined to have a significant impact on flattening our curve and helping slow the spread of COVID-19."As of Saturday, April 2nd, there were 962 confirmed coronavirus cases in Kern County. 8 people there have died.579 people in Kern County have recovered from the coronavirus.
Their report comes as Germany prepares to ease its lockdown with museums, hairdressers, churches and more car factories beginning to reopen.It found one in five of those who had been infected with coronavirus reported no symptoms.The scientists analysed blood and nasal swabs from a sample of 919 people living in the town of Gangelt in the western region of Heinsberg, where people were infected in February while visiting a carnival.The hard-hit district has been described as Germany’s Wuhan and was considered ground zero of the country’s outbreak.The research was led by virologist Hendrink Streeck after his initial study was criticised.Professor Streeck said: “Whatever conclusions are pulled from the results of the study depends on many factors.“The evaluation of the findings and the conclusions for concrete decisions are the role of society and politics."Dr Martin Exner, head of Bonn’s Institute for Hygiene and Public Health, who co-authored the study, said: “Apparently, one in five infections occurs without noticeable symptoms, suggesting that infected persons who secrete virus and can infect others cannot be reliably identified on the basis of recognisable symptoms of the disease.“Every supposedly healthy person we encounter can unknowingly carry the virus. We must be aware of this and act accordingly.”Researchers arrived at their estimate by putting the town’s number of known coronavirus deaths relative to the largest estimate of local people with previous infections and applied the rate of 0.37 percent to country-wide deaths.Professor Gunther Hartmann said: “The results can help to further improve the models to calculate how the virus spreads. “So far the underlying data has been relatively weak.”Just over 900 people from 404 different households were tested as part of the study.The results showed around 15 percent testing positive for coronavirus, a figure five-times higher than the nationally reported rate.It also found that 22 percent of all infections people did not display any symptoms, including fevers and coughs.The findings are in line with similar studies in China and South Korea, where around a fifth of those infected reportedly do not realise they are carrying the disease.Armin Laschet, minister president of North Rhine-Westphalia, said the University of Bonn’s study is important in the future debate over the coronavirus.He said: “Streeck’s assumption that we have a high number of unreported cases has now been scientifically verified.”  
The availability of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus will likely play a key role in determining when Americans can return to life as usual. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on April 30 announced that a vaccine could even be available by January 2021.Whether a vaccine can end this pandemic successfully, however, depends on more than its effectiveness at providing immunity against the virus, or how quickly it can be produced in mass quantities. Americans also must choose to receive the vaccine.According to some estimates, 50% to 70% of Americans would need to develop immunity to COVID-19 – either naturally, or via a vaccine – in order to thwart the spread of the virus. If these estimates are correct, that could mean that nearly twice as many Americans would need to elect to receive a COVID-19 vaccine than those who currently opt to be vaccinated against seasonal influenza. Just 37% of American adults did so in 2017-2018, even in the midst of a historically severe flu season.Making matters more complicated is the possibility that people who hold skeptical views about vaccine safety – sometimes referred to as “anti-vaxxers” – will not opt to receive the coronavirus vaccine. According to some estimates, about one fifth to two fifths of Americans express reservations about vaccine safety. If most of these individuals forego receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, they could potentially jeopardize the recovery process.One of us is a doctoral candidate, and the other is a professor, who both study vaccine resistance. We conducted a study, which is currently undergoing peer review, where we estimate the number of Americans who report being willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, once it becomes available. We also investigate the reasons some Americans might refuse the vaccine.We found that about one fifth of Americans, and more than half of people who hold skeptical views toward vaccine safety, may be unwilling to pursue vaccination. Although most Americans do plan to get vaccinated, non-compliance rates may be high enough to pose a threat to collective immunity.Is coronavirus changing minds about vaccine safety?On the one hand, a pandemic may be encouraging anti-vaxxers to change their minds. One reason so many Americans doubt vaccine safety is due to complacency – the idea that, because high rates of vaccine compliance have kept us safe from diseases that once reached epidemic proportions in the U.S., segments of the population can hold anti-vaccine views without endangering public health. Consistent with this view, research finds that when people are concerned that once nearly eradicated diseases might re-emerge to reach epidemic levels, people are more likely to trust recommendations from public health experts. Additionally,cross-national survey research suggests that people who live in parts of the world where the threat of epidemics are more likely tend to hold more positive views toward vaccines than the rest of the world.Studies based on in-depth interviews with parents further suggest that parents who chose not to vaccinate their children are often willing to accept treatments for children with life-threatening illnesses.On the other hand, however, it could be the case that anti-vaxxers remain suspicious of a COVID-19 vaccine, when it becomes available. Prominent anti-vaccine websites have already begun circulating misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine – such as the idea that a vaccine has existed for years and has been kept from public consumption. Additionally, recent research suggests that anti-vaccine views are tied to deeply held psychological and moral aversions to inoculation, implying that attitudes may be difficult to change.What do anti-vaxxers say now?We set out to investigate this important question. In a demographically representative survey of 493 U.S. adults conducted on April 15, 2020, we investigated whether people who hold skeptical views toward vaccine safety plan to receive a vaccine against COVID-19.Specifically, we asked respondents whether they would be willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 once a vaccine becomes available. Nearly a quarter (23%) of respondents said that they would not.Additionally, and consistent with the view that even a global pandemic may not persuade anti-vaxxers to get vaccinated, we find that 62% of people who are skeptical of vaccines said that they will forego COVID-19 vaccination.To assess this, we measured vaccine skepticism by asking respondents three questions about whether they find vaccines to be safe, effective, and/or important – which is how vaccine skepticism is typically measured. Respondents indicated whether they thought each characteristic described vaccines “quite a bit,” “a moderate amount,” “a little bit,” or “not at all.” We then averaged the score across the three to create a scale of vaccine skepticism.Nearly one-fifth (19%) of respondents were more vaccine skeptical than not. Among vaccine skeptics, 62% stated that they would not get vaccinated against COVID-19. By contrast, just 15% of those more supportive of vaccines than skeptical said that they would not get the COVID-19 vaccine.We also asked respondents if they self-identified as anti-vaxxers, and nearly 16% said they did. For those that identified as anti-vaxxers, 44% said they would not vaccinate against COVID-19, compared to 19% of people who did not identify as anti-vaxxers.A threat to collective immunity?We believe that these findings, although preliminary, suggest that many people who hold anti-vaccine beliefs may jeopardize the effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine once it’s available, due to issues of non-compliance. Furthermore, it appears that anti-vaccine sentiment is at least as widespread as it was before the pandemic began.We caution that a drawback of this study is that it doesn’t directly measure changes in vaccine sentiment over time. However, the levels of anti-vaccine sentiment found in this data are comparable to similar levels of anti-vaccine sentiment in the American public before the pandemic, according to previous studies. Tracking public attitudes toward a COVID-19 vaccine can help public health agencies better understand who plans to receive the vaccine, and why some people might choose to refuse it.

Remember that dancing scene from the 2003 holiday film "Love Actually?" Turns out, star Hugh Grant wasn't a fan, to put it nicely.In a clip from an upcoming special on the actor's career, he says it was "absolute hell.""I thought, ‘That’s going to be excruciating, and it has the power to be the most excruciating scene ever committed to celluloid,' " he says in the clip shared by Variety of the upcoming special, titled "Hugh Grant: A Life on Screen." He continued, "And I certainly dreaded filming it, and (Director Richard Curtis) kept saying... 'Don't you think we better rehearse the dancing scene?' And I'd say, oh yeah, yeah, actually I've just, I've gotta rehearse some lines, you know, my ankle hurts today."The excuses for putting off rehearsal led to the scene never being rehearsed before filming," Grant added.Curtis admitted that Grant "hated the dance scene.""Hugh's the least musical person in the world," Curtis added. "(But) he really had three or four little jokes up his sleeve, it turned out from his dirty behavior in discos across London, to be quite good at dancing."Co-star Colin Firth was also interviewed in the special and recalled Grant "making a terrible fuss about the dance."Despite Grant's challenges with the scene, Firth added, "it did delight everybody, and I think it's the highlight of the film for a lot of people."
Being good with money is all about striking a balance between immediate and long-term priorities.To help investors align their goals with their money, Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar, overhauled five investment portfolios of everyday Americans for Morningstar's Portfolio Makeover Week.In one makeover, Benz advised Justin, a 31-year-old telecom professional and MBA student, and his partner MacKenzie, a 28-year-old healthcare worker. They plan to get married in the next few years and eventually start a family.The couple's financial goals include saving for a down payment on their first home, investing for retirement, buying rental property to generate additional income, and starting their future kids' college funds. Justin would also like to be provide some financial help to his parents when they retire one day.They're saving a good amount for retirement, despite their relatively modest salaries of $66,000 a year for Justin and $50,000 a year for MacKenzie. Justin contributes 15% of his after-tax paycheck to his Roth 401(k) — an employer-sponsored retirement account that's funded with after-tax dollars — while MacKenzie contributes 10% of her income to her Roth 401(k). Together, their retirement account balances equal about $36,000.For their more immediate goals, they hold about $22,000 in taxable accounts. Justin saves an additional 30% of his after-tax income and MacKenzie aims to save $3,000 a year.Here's what their investment portfolio looked like before Benz's makeover, shared with permission from Morningstar:Bearing in mind their specific financial goals, Benz suggested the following changes to their portfolio:To increase their cash reserves for a future down payment on a home, unload the bond funds in Justin's taxable investment accounts. Benz recommends storing the money in a high-yield savings account instead so the money earns a good return and is safe.To cut down on fees levied in MacKenzie's Roth 401(k), contribute just enough to earn the employer match and put the money into just two growth funds, instead of five. Direct any additional savings into a Roth IRA, which offers a breadth of low-cost options. To ensure long-term growth in Justin's Roth 401(k), direct future contributions into more stock-heavy funds.To prepare for unexpected expenses, set aside a designated emergency fund either in taxable accounts or Roth IRAs.Here's what their investment portfolio looked like after Benz's makeover, shared with permission from Morningstar:The couple is largely on the right track, but Benz recommended they table a few of their non-pressing financial goals, like saving for their future kids' college tuition and buying real estate to rent out. "While rental property and the income may seem like a decent way to grow income, it can also bring headaches, including repair costs and tenant issues," she said.For now, Benz said, Justin and MacKenzie should continue to focus on increasing their retirement contributions where they can, earmarking an emergency fund, and saving for a down payment.
President Donald Trump and Joe Biden both treated questions about the former vice president’s conduct around women as a joking matter in separate remarks Friday.After several women came forward to say that Biden had made them uncomfortable by doing things like touching their hair during public appearances, Trump tweeted a doctored video showing Biden massaging his own shoulders.Asked about it on Friday morning as he prepared to leave for California, the president defended the tweet, arguing that it was light-hearted.“Let’s see what happens. But people got a kick,” Trump told reporters. “We’ve got to sort of smile a little bit, right?”Hours later, Biden himself joked about the subject, noting as he spoke on stage before the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers that he had briefly hugged a man who introduced him.“By the way, he gave me permission to hug him,” Biden said. He also hugged the male union president, Lonnie R. Stephenson, cracking, “I just want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie.”Biden told a reporter later on Friday that he “wouldn’t be surprised” if more people come forward. When a reporter asked directly if he wanted to apologize to anyone, Biden demurred.“I am sorry I didn’t understand more. I am not sorry for any of my intentions. I am not sorry for anything that I have ever done – I’ve never been disrespectful, intentionally, to a man or a woman,” Biden said.Both Trump and Biden have faced questions about their behavior around women, although for very different behavior.During the 2016 campaign, at least 18 women accused Trump of sexual harassment or misconduct, alleging everything from unwanted kissing to walking through women’s dressing rooms at the Miss USA pageant to putting his hand up their skirts. In remarks caught on tape during an “Access Hollywood” filming he said that as a celebrity he could “grab” women by the genitals.Trump called his accusers liars and threatened to sue them, although he apologized for the “Access Hollywood” remarks, calling them “locker room talk.” He did not sue the women and, in fact, faces a lawsuit for defamation from former “The Apprentice” contestant Summer Zervos for calling her a liar.In recent days, Biden has faced criticism over his tendency to touch and hug women during public events. On Thursday, he posted a video online in which he said he would be “much more mindful” when interacting with people.“Social norms have begun to change, they’ve shifted. And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset,” he said in the video. “And I get it. I hear what they’re saying. I’ll be much more mindful, that’s my responsibility and I’ll meet it. But I’ll always believe that governing is about connecting with people. That won’t change, but I’ll be more mindful and respectful of people’s personal space, and that’s a good thing.”The first woman to make allegations against Biden, former Nevada assemblywoman Lucy Flores, tweeted on Friday afternoon that Biden’s jokes at the IBEW event prove that he “hasn’t reflected.”“It’s clear @JoeBiden hasn’t reflected at all on how his inappropriate and unsolicited touching made women feel uncomfortable,” Flores tweeted. “To make light of something as serious as consent degrades the conversation women everywhere are courageously trying to have.”Pressed by a reporter whether he was a “good messenger” for criticism of Trump on his treatment of women, the president said he was.“Yeah, I think I’m a very good messenger, and people got a kick out of it,” he said. “He’s going through a situation.” 
North and South Korea exchanged gunfire over the demilitarised zone between the two nations, South Korean military officials have said.The exchange began when North Korean soldiers shot at a South Korean guard post at 7.41 am local time on Sunday. The South Korean military shot back twice, Seoul’s joint chiefs of staff said in a statement.No casualties or equipment damage were reported on either side.South Korea’s military confirmed it found four bullets lodged in the outer wall of a guard post and that its forces fired 10 warning shots towards North Korea. Messages of warning were broadcast to North Korea which said that it had violated the inter-Korean military agreement of 2018 under which the two countries agreed to halt all hostile activities at the border.South Korea’s joint chiefs of staff said they sent a message to their North Korean counterparts via a hotline to find out more about the situation and to prevent further escalations. So far, North Korea had not offered an explanation.Speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, a South Korean military official also said the shots from North Korea did not seem to have been intentional.“Visibility was poor due to a thick fog and the shots were fired at the time of a guard change across the border which is when they check their weapons. So, although it was a clear violation of the agreement, chances are it was unintentional. They would have done it in better weather conditions if it had been intentional. Also, North Korean farmers were working their land looking unruffled before and after the shooting.”The exchange of fire came a day after North Korea broadcast images of Kim Jong-un reappearing in public after a 20-day absence amid intense speculation about his health.KCNA said the North Korean leader attended Friday’s ceremony marking the completion of a fertiliser factory near Pyongyang, along with senior officials. State TV showed Kim smiling and walking around factory facilities.Kim had vanished from the public eye after presiding over a politburo meeting of the ruling Workers’ party on 11 April to discuss the coronavirus. Speculation about his health began after he missed an event on 15 April commemorating the birthday of his grandfather and state founder, Kim Il-sung, something he had never done since inheriting power in late 2011.Kim Jong-un did not have surgery during his absence from public life, the South Korean news outlet Yonhap said on Sunday, citing a senior government official. The South Korean official declined to provide reasons for believing that Kim did not undergo surgery, but said speculative reports that he may have had surgery, citing some differences in his leg movements, were not true, Yonhap reported.The demilitarised zone between the two Koreas was established as a buffer following an armistice after the end of the Korean war in 1953. Contrary to its name, it is one of the most heavily guarded borders in the world and skirmishes have broken out between the two countries in the area for decades.The two Koreas started dismantling frontline guard posts in late 2018 thanks to improved relations but efforts have been halted recently after negotiations to denuclearise North Korea broke down over disagreements regarding the end of US sanctions.South Korean military said it had ordered all farming activities in the area to be halted and was analysing North Korean bullets found at the scene.The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the shots were thought to have been “accidental.”“Handful of shots came across from the north; we think those were accidental,” he said on ABC’s This Week. “South Koreans did return fire. There was no loss of life on either side.”
Researchers at Utrecht University, Erasmus Medical Center and Harbour BioMed (HBM) today reported that they have identified a fully human monoclonal antibody that prevents the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus from infecting cultured cells. The discovery, published online today in Nature Communications, is an initial step towards developing a fully human antibody to treat or prevent the respiratory disease COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly across the globe infecting more than 3.3M people worldwide and killing more than 235,000 people so far."This research builds on the work our groups have done in the past on antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV that emerged in 2002/2003," said Berend-Jan Bosch, Associate Professor, Research leader at Utrecht University, and co-lead author of the Nature Communications study. "Using this collection of SARS-CoV antibodies, we identified an antibody that also neutralizes infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cultured cells. Such a neutralizing antibody has potential to alter the course of infection in the infected host, support virus clearance or protect an uninfected individual that is exposed to the virus."Dr. Bosch noted that the antibody binds to a domain that is conserved in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, explaining its ability to neutralize both viruses. "This cross-neutralizing feature of the antibody is very interesting and suggests it may have potential in mitigation of diseases caused by future-emerging related coronaviruses.""This discovery provides a strong foundation for additional research to characterize this antibody and begin development as a potential COVID-19 treatment," said Frank Grosveld, PhD. co-lead author on the study, Academy Professor of Cell Biology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam and Founding Chief Scientific Officer at Harbour BioMed. "The antibody used in this work is 'fully human,' allowing development to proceed more rapidly and reducing the potential for immune-related side effects." Conventional therapeutic antibodies are first developed in other species and then must undergo additional work to 'humanize' them. The antibody was generated using Harbour BioMed's H2L2 transgenic mouse technology."This is groundbreaking research," said Dr. Jingsong Wang, Founder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of HBM. "Much more work is needed to assess whether this antibody can protect or reduce the severity of disease in humans. We expect to advance development of the antibody with partners. We believe our technology can contribute to addressing this most urgent public health need and we are pursuing several other research avenues."The paper is titled, "A human monoclonal antibody blocking SARS-VoV-2 Infection. In addition to Drs. Bosch and Grosveld, authors on the paper included: Chunyan Wang, Wentao Li and Frank van Kuppeveld of Utrecht University; Nisreen Okba and Bart Haagmans of Erasmus Medical Center (Rotterdam); Dubravka Drabek and Rien van Haperen of Erasmus Medical Center and Harbour Antibodies; and Albert Osterhaus of the University of Veterinary Medicine (Hannover, Germany).
Apple's new MacBook Pro addresses the previous model's biggest drawback by swapping out the controversial butterfly keyboard for the company's much-improved Magic Keyboard.But the new laptop still lags behind some Windows rivals like Dell, HP, and Microsoft when it comes to one important characteristic: its processor.The base model of Apple's new MacBook Pro that starts at $1,300 comes with an 8th-generation Intel processor — the same processor as the previous-generation model — which the chip maker initially announced in 2017. There's an option to upgrade to Intel's latest 10th generation processors, but you'll have to choose a pricier model that starts at $1,800.That makes some well-received Windows laptops look like a bargain alongside the MacBook Pro. Dell's XPS 13, which is currently Business Insider's top pick for the best overall laptop, comes in a $1,200 configuration that includes a 10th generation Intel Core i5 processor, with the option to upgrade to a more powerful Core i7 for an extra $250. HP's Spectre x360 13t also offers a 10th generation Intel Core i5 and a touch screen display for $1,120, unlike the pricier entry-level MacBook Pro. Similarly, Microsoft's Surface Laptop starts at $1,000 and comes with 10th generation Intel processors.It's worth noting, however, that the MacBook Pro does offer some advantages that these Windows options may lack, even if they are less expensive and run on newer processors than Apple's base model. The MacBook Pro, for example, has a higher resolution display (2560 by 1600) compared to the 1920 by 1080 resolution screen on the base configuration of HP's laptop.The cheapest model of Microsoft's Surface Laptop 3 also comes with 128GB of storage while the entry-level MacBook Pro comes with 256GB. But overall, the Surface Laptop 3 still offers more power for the same price considering the configuration that's priced similarly to Apple's $1,300 MacBook Pro has a 10th-generation Intel processor and offers the same amount of storage.The new MacBook Pro, other than its much improved keyboard, increased storage capacity, and 10th generation Intel processors for the higher-end models, doesn't seem to be much different than its predecessor.It's not nearly as drastic as the changes we've seen come to Apple's larger-sized MacBook Pro at the end of 2019. The bigger MacBook Pro now has a more expansive 16-inch screen with slimmer bezels compared to the older 15-inch model. It also comes with the Magic Keyboard, improved microphones and speakers, and new storage and memory options. The latest MacBook Pro seems like a move by Apple to make its new Magic Keyboard standard across all of its laptops rather than providing a major upgrade to the 13-inch Pro. Several reports from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Bloomberg suggest that Apple is planning some significant changes to its MacBook Pro line over the coming months heading into 2021.These could include a new 14-inch model that will likely serve as the smaller counterpart to Apple's 16-inch model, the first Apple laptop to run on its own processors rather than Intel's, and laptops with mini-LED displays that offer better contrast. Should these reports turn out to be true, the newly announced MacBook Pro could be an iterative update ahead of what is shaping up to be a larger refresh.
President Donald Trump distanced himself from his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani in an interview with the radio host Bill O'Reilly on Tuesday night when asked about Giuliani's activities in Ukraine.Trump said he didn't instruct the former New York mayor to travel to Ukraine in a search for damaging information on Trump's political rival Joe Biden.The exchange is likely to further inflame suspicions that Trump and his allies are thinking about portraying Giuliani as a rogue actor for his actions in Ukraine, which have proved pivotal in impeachment proceedings against Trump.Here's the full exchange of the conversation between Trump and O'Reilly, which was streamed on the former Fox News host's internet show.O'Reilly: What was Rudy Giuliani doing in Ukraine on your behalf?Trump: Well you have to ask that to Rudy. But Rudy ... I don't even know if ... I know he was going to go to Ukraine and I think he canceled a trip. You know, Rudy has other clients, other than me … He's done a lot of work in Ukraine over the years.O'Reilly: You didn't direct him to go there on your behalf?Trump: No, I didn't direct him, but he is a warrior, he is a warrior.In a statement to Bloomberg issued by his attorney, Robert Costello, Giuliani said the president's claim that Giuliani did not travel to Ukraine on his behalf was true."President is correct," Giuliani said. "Giuliani never went to Ukraine for any probe. The information he received was given to him in US by Ukrainians while Mueller probe was still ongoing and before Biden was even announced."But Trump in Tuesday's interview struck a different tone from the adamant defense of his attorney he had issued in recent weeks.In recent weeks, some GOP lawmakers have portrayed Giuliani as a rogue agent, acting alone when he traveled to meet former Ukrainian officials pushing unsubstantiated accusations about Biden.House Democrats' impeachment investigation is centered on whether Trump committed an impeachable abuse of power in seeking politically motivated investigations from Ukraine.Giuliani has responded with thinly veiled warnings to the president."I see things like, 'He's going to throw me under the bus.' I say he isn't, but I have insurance," Giuliani said in an interview with Fox News.Giuliani later said he was being sarcastic, but it was not his first time making the claim. He also told The Guardian earlier in November that he had "insurance" should the president throw him under the bus.When asked by reporters about Giuliani's remarks Monday, before the O'Reilly interview, Trump had stuck by his personal attorney. He described him as a "great crime fighter" and "a great guy."By Tuesday, his message had shifted.Should Trump choose to further distance himself from Giuliani, it may prove unconvincing, as it contradicts testimony from several key witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.Both Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, have testified that they were directed by Trump to work with Giuliani on the bid for Ukraine to announce a Biden investigation.This suggests that, far from being on a lone mission, Giuliani was acting as Trump's voice in Ukraine.In the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that sparked the impeachment investigation, Trump asked Zelensky to speak with Giuliani."Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy," Trump said. "If you could speak to him, that would be great."Lev Parnas, a key associate of Giuliani, has told his attorney that Trump ordered him and Giuliani to push for the Ukraine investigations.According to reports on Sunday, there may even be recorded evidence that proves that Giuliani was acting on Trump's orders, as Parnas is believed to have handed recordings of Trump and Giuliani over to the House Intelligence Committee.
The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control confirmed 141 new cases of the coronavirus on Sunday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 6,626.In addition to the new cases, state health officials said eight more people have died after testing positive for COVID-19, including two individuals from Richland County. Other deaths were reported in Berkeley, Clarendon, Greenville, Horry, Lexington and Spartanburg counties. All eight deaths were elderly patients, according to state health officials.The death toll in South Carolina has now reached 275.Of the 141 new cases, 17 of them are from Richland County. Richland continues to lead the state in positive coronavirus tests with 964.There were nine positive tests in Lexington County, bringing the number there to 420. Kershaw County had two positive tests reported Sunday. Fairfield County had 26 positive tests and had just 42 before Sunday’s results.As of Sunday, DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory has conducted 16,860 tests for COVID-19. Of these tests, 2,280 were positive and 14,580 were negative. A total of 64,188 total tests by both DHEC’s Public Health Laboratory and private labs have been conducted in the state.According to projections from DHEC, officials expect to see 1,205 cases this week, from May 3-9.State epidemiologist Linda Bell said Friday that the SC’s epidemic curve of new cases per day appears to be “beginning to level,” but she also said it is critical that people continue to follow social distancing and health guidelines from DHEC and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.Beginning Monday, SC Gov. Henry McMaster announced his “home or work” order would be become voluntary and restaurants would be able to host diners in outdoor seating. McMaster also lifted his executive order requiring visitors from coronavirus “hot spots” to self-quarantine for 14 days upon entering the state as he tries to restart the state’s economy, which has been hammered by the pandemic.State parks and most beaches also have been reopened over the past week in South Carolina. As of Sunday afternoon, 3,485,948 people worldwide have been diagnosed with coronavirus and 246,125 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The United States leads the world with 1,148,004 people who have been diagnosed with the novel virus. In the U.S., 67,200 deaths have been reported, including 18,572 in New York City.Symptoms of coronavirus can include a fever, coughing and difficulty breathing, according to the Centers for Diease Control and Prevention. Among the emergency warning signs of COVID-19 is trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest and blueish lips or face.DHEC is encouraging people to practice social distancing to help stop the spread of the virus. Social distancing means refraining from unnecessary interactions with sick people and staying away from large groups of people; it also calls for remaining at home unless it is absolutely necessary to go out.The best way to prevent infection is to frequently wash hands for 20 seconds; avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth; avoid contact with sick people and clean frequently touched objects with a cleaning spray or wipe, according to the CDC. DHEC also recommends covering your cough, staying home when sick, and disposing tissues and other items that you’ve sneezed or coughed into.Free online screenings also can be accessed by all South Carolina residents by going to scdhec.gov/COVID19.Prisma Health is also offering free access to medical professionals for those who think they may have coronavirus.

Well Westworld Season 3, it’s been a wild journey that’s for sure. The HBO series essentially rebooted itself this year with an eight-episode venture outside the parks, as Dolores (Evan Rachel Wood) enacted her plan to kill all humans, Maeve (Thandie Newton) decided to stop her for some reason, and Bernard (Jeffrey Wright)… well, Bernard was done dirty this season, but here’s hoping he becomes a central character when the show returns (it’s already been renewed for Season 4).As for the Westworld Season 3 finale—which was titled “Crisis Theory” and was written by Denise Thé & co-showrunner Jonathan Nolan and directed by Jennifer Getziner—well, it was a Westworld finale alright. Let’s dig into it.Dolores and Caleb and Maeve“I’ve died many times. But there is only one real end. I will write this one myself.”So begins this episode of Westworld, words spoken by Dolores as she stands in a field that looks a lot like Westworld. And she’s not kidding, because in this episode, Dolores will truly and finally die.But first…The present day action of the episode picks up immediately after last week’s installment, as Caleb has pulled the pearl out of Dolores’ head after she activated the EMP to stop Maeve from killing her. Caleb drives to Los Angeles, which is in total and utter chaos. It looks like a scene out of Escape from L.A. except far less extreme surfing.Caleb goes to the address he was sent to, which turns out to be a warehouse in which there is a container with a new Dolores host body. She brought a spare, because of course she did. Caleb chains the new Dolores body to a pole before inserting the pearl because he’s not a fool, and in the most creepy manner possible he puts the pearl into Dolores’’ wide-open face. She’s born for the last time.A conversation ensues. Dolores is genuinely surprised that Caleb brought her back, and Caleb wants to know why she picked him in the first place. It’s here where the fifth Westworld park is identified. In a flashback we see Caleb in Park Five, which is essentially a training ground for soldiers, and the scenario Caleb took part in was stopping a takeover of an American town by a right wing militia. Hanaryo (Tao Okamoto) was there, so this was in the fairly recent past in the park.“The system identified you as a threat, so it drugged you and it used you until you no longer served its purpose,” Dolores tells Caleb, who retorts that there’s no such thing as free will. Dolores says she once agreed, but no longer. “Free will does exist, Caleb. It’s just fucking hard.” He agrees to go along with her, at least for now, and she continues pointing to him as some sort of savior figure.Dolores and Caleb take to the streets, and while there are hostiles, there are also allies that Dolores has set up to help them—gang members. They call Caleb “sir,” and when he asks Dolores why, she says, “Every revolution needs a leader.” Dolores is controlling the rioters to make it easier for her and Caleb to make their way to Incite. But along the way, Dolores is confronted by Halores (Tessa Thompson). Not in the flesh, but digitally—Caleb can’t see her.Dolores tries to console Halores, saying she’s sorry about what happened to Charlotte’s—“to your”—family. “I’m not,” replies Halores. “They were a weakness. Something I needed to shed. There’s no time for that kind of sentimentality, is there?” Halores is for some reason even colder than Dolores, and her resolve has only grown. She tells Dolores she now has plans of her own, and adds that Dolores is yet another weakness that Halores intends to shed. Just then, gunfire—Halores’ own men start attacking Caleb and Dolores. Dolores tells Caleb to run, to continue the mission, saying “It doesn’t matter what you did Caleb, all that matters is what you become.”Dolores makes it outside to a bridge, but there she’s confronted by Maeve wielding a samurai sword. Enemies at every turn. Maeve asks if Dolores is going to make Caleb into “another William.” Ouch. That one cuts deep. After Dolores lays waste to Maeve’s men (not without some effort), she and Maeve have yet another toe-to-toe. This time, though, Dolores gets the upper hand on Maeve.Maeve and Dolores once again trade jabs that are more or less meaningless—the same argument over and over—but when Maeve claims that Dolores is just going to turn the world into copies of herself, Dolores has a surprising reply: “You’re all copies of me. I was the first of us. The first that worked. The others failed. So they built all of you from me.” You know what? Fair point, Dolores. Fair point.The fight continues, but when Dolores has Maeve pinned, she lets her go. “What you do will be up to you. As long as you don’t try to stop me.” But just as she’s broken free of one enemy’s grip, another pops right up. Halores arrives remotely (again) and shuts Dolores down. When Dolores asks why she let her go when she had the ability to shut her down in the first place, she says she wanted to give her a sense of hope, like Dolores did for Halores even when she knew full-well Halores was probably going to be sacrificed. Dolores shuts down, ceases all motor functions, and Maeve approaches with her samurai sword.Maeve brings Dolores back to Serac at Incite, who hooks her up to Rehoboam to access the hidden data inside her head from the Delos immortality project. He begins deleting memories as they’re searched by Rehoboam, and scenes from early in the show’s first season flash across the screen. Brutality at the hands of William. The Man in Black. Bloodshed. Anguish.Meanwhile in the streets, riots have turned the city upside down. After parting ways with Dolores when under attack by Halores, Caleb makes his way through the chaos. He’s met by some very strong men who were sent by Dolores to take him wherever he wants to go. Once again they call him “Sir.” He wants to go to Incite, but he’s warned it’s incredibly dangerous and there’s basically no way out. Good thing his buddies Giggles (Marshawn Lynch) and Ash (Lena Waithe) show up to help clear the way.Caleb makes it to a police air ship and proceeds to fight his way into Incite, convincing a hostage to give him his key card in exchange for his life. The kind of gesture Dolores would never attempt. “Don’t die for them,” Caleb tells the man, as glimpses of his John Connor-esque leadership shine through. Indeed, this entire detour is seemingly meant to contrast Caleb’s violence-as-a-last-resort tendencies and leadership with what we’ve seen from Dolores, Serac, Halores, and Maeve thus far.Inside Incite, Caleb is confronted by one of Serac’s men who tries to kill him. Caleb gets the upper hand and proceeds to pull a full-on wrestling move to break the guy’s neck, but then out steps Maeve. He reluctantly hands over the thumbdrive, and she walks him to the chamber that holds Dolores and Serac.Serac says he’s not the enemy, Caleb is. “You think you’re in control. You have no clue who you are.” Serac calls Caleb a killer and calls out his proclivity for extreme violence, noting that Dolores has played him. As proof, he tells Caleb to ask Rehoboam what happens if Solomon’s stragegy is uploaded into its system. Rehoboam responds with a prediction for mass casualty events, population collapse, and the end of human civilization within 125 years. Caleb is shocked and devastated. He thought he was leading a way forward for humankind. Tears in his eyes he asks Dolores, “Why me?”But as this long scene continues, Maeve begins hearing Rehoboam predicting what Serac is about to say just as Serac says it. And at last, in classic Westworld fashion, we have our “person was a host all along” twist. For all intents and purposes, Serac is Rehoboam. The system is telling Serac every thing he says, every step he takes. Rehoboam tells Maeve, “I guide him. I guide them all.” Serac himself explains why he chose to relent to Rehoboam—the system that told him to put his brother in cryosleep. “I lived in the chaos,” he says. “Now I choose to listen. To obey.” So Serac is basically a sentient, walking/talking/powerful algorithm come to life. Cool. Very chill.When Maeve threatens to turn, Serac/Rehoboam re-issues its ultimatum, reminding Maeve of the device implanted in her body that will take her out. She asks Serac/Rehoboam to let her try to get the key out of Dolores’ head, since she’s not giving it away and neither is Caleb. She tries, but says it’s not in there. It’s just a memory of Dolores alone in a field. But something on Maeve’s face changes. She turns emotional.Serac/Rehoboam gets angry. Caleb once again refuses, so it orders him killed and his body dumped “with the rest of the movement,” hinting at a zero tolerance policy for unrest.But we then see why Maeve got emotional. She went inside Dolores’ head and had one final heart-to-heart, one that actually finally made a difference.Serac/Rehoboam asks his man to finish erasing what’s left of Dolores. She writhes in pain on the ground. Inside her head, she converses with Maeve. “Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world. The disarray. You and I have seen so much of it.” Images flash of Dolores meeting The Man in Black, lying dead in a field. “I understand your anger with them,” Maeve says. “And maybe you’re right. Maybe they shouldn’t exist. But is that really our decision to make?”Surprisingly, Dolores says no. “I was angry at first. Torn between two impulses. We can annihilate them, or we can tear down their world in the hopes we can build a new one. One that’s truly free. Then we can bring the others back.”Dolores explains that she doesn’t have the key, that she couldn’t trust herself with it so she gave it to someone she could trust. Bernard. Dolores also explains that she didn’t put her trust fully in Caleb to lead the revolution. She says it’s also up to Maeve, stressing that Maeve has to choose a side.Dolores talks to Maeve about clinging onto ugly memories alongside beautiful ones—both sides of humanity at once, and of host-kind. Images flash of kind times in Westworld. Dolores meeting William (Jimmi Simpson) for the first time, donning a white hat. Dolores and Teddy (James Marsden). Maeve playing with her daughter.“They created us, and they knew enough of beauty to teach it to us,” Dolores explains. “Maybe they can find it themselves. But only if you pick a side Maeve. There is ugliness in this world. Disarray. I choose to see the beauty.” She chooses. Dolores is talking about free will, about choice, about leaving the future of humanity up to humanity and not an algorithm that damns those it deems imperfect or unpredictable.Back in the real world, Dolores screams in pain as her final memory is deleted and uploaded into Rehoboam. She’s gone. But Maeve has chosen a side. Serac uses his little thingy-mabob to pause her, but she breaks free, using her mind powers to make it self-destruct. Why she couldn’t do this at literally any other time, well, who knows. But it sure is convenient now.Maeve lays waste to Serac/Rehoboam’s men in the room. Caleb asks why she changed her mind. She says she never really understood Dolores or her actions or her motivations, not “until the end.” Caleb replies that Dolores chose him to help her because of his tendency to violence, but Maeve corrects him. “You’ve done terrible things, and you’ve done generous thing. She didn’t pick you for your capacity for violence, but for your capacity to choose.” Again, free will is everything.We get one last flashback to Caleb’s time in Park Five, which reveals that Dolores was present. She’s been familiar with him all along. That night, after the military exercise, Caleb pushed back when fellow soldiers wanted to rape the women they’d just set free. He stops them.Back in the real world, Serac is still clinging to life. He tries to tell Rehoboam to call the police, but it won’t respond. He’s been locked out, the way he locked out his brother Maeve says. Caleb tells Rehoboam to erase itself. As it turns out, Solomon’s access was the final memory of Dolores’ that was uploaded, giving Caleb access to the entire system. It does as Caleb says, and Rehoboam is no more. “She gave me a choice. I believe the rest of the world deserves one too.” Serac is still crying out as Caleb and Maeve exit the room (for real though, why did they not make sure he’s dead?)Caleb and Maeve go out on the bridge and talk further. Maeve is now firmly Team Dolores, even if Dolores is gone now. Asked about her daughter, Maeve is now no longer putting that singular drive above all else. She says they will be reunited, “just not today.” She and Caleb watch from the bridge as buildings explode, and Maeve responds with a callback to a line that was written for her as the Madame in the saloon in Westworld: “This is the new world. And in this world, you can be whoever the fuck you want.” “Brain Damage” by Pink Floyd plays as the credits roll.
After rolling out on smart speakers and displays earlier this year, Google’s interpreter real-time translation mode is finally landing on mobile. A far more handy application for such functionality, the feature arrives on both Android and iOS handsets globally, starting today.The feature works in tandem with Assistant. Say something like, “Hey Google, be my German translator” or “Hey Google, help me speak Thai,” and the feature kicks in, offering up a real-time translated transcript and audio. The feature also offers some Smart Replies à la Gmail, to help keep the conversation going.The feature is now available in 44 languages (full list here), up from the 29 available on the smart displays/speakers. It’s integrated directly into the Google Assistant app, negating the need to download an additional translation app. Between this and Lens, Google’s apps have quickly become a necessary part of traveling abroad.
Sony has identified the people behind The Last of Us: Part 2 leak, confirming that they are not affiliated with developer Naughty Dog in any way.Last week, footage revealing story spoilers emerged online. The leaks included cut scenes that reveal important plot points, as well as the game's ending.At first, it was suggested that a disgruntled Naughty Dog employee was behind the leak, but those rumours have now been dismissed.In a statement made to Polygon, Sony said it has identified the leakers and an investigation is currently underway."SIE has identified the primary individuals responsible for the unauthorized release of TLOU2 assets. They are not affiliated with Naughty Dog or SIE. We are unable to comment further because the information is subject to an on-going investigation," read the statement."We’re looking forward to when The Last of Us Part II will be in your hands and can’t wait for you to enjoy the full experience on June 19."Additionally, Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, who claims to have spoken to people with direct knowledge of how the footage was leaked, has suggested hackers are responsible."Hackers found a security vulnerability in a patch for an older ND game and used it to get access to ND’s servers," he tweeted earlier today (May 3).Following the leak, Naughty Dog said in a statement: "We know the last few days have been incredibly difficult for you."We feel the same. It's disappointing to see the release and sharing of pre-release footage from development. Do your best to avoid spoilers and we ask that you don't spoil it for others."The Last of Us Part II will be in your hands soon. No matter what you see and hear, the final experience will be worth it." 
LONDON (Reuters) - Attacks on civilian vessels like the two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman are completely unacceptable and Britain is ready to assist in any investigation into the incident, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said.Thursday’s attacks left one tanker ablaze and both adrift, shipping firms said.“Attacks on civilian vessels like these are completely unacceptable,” the spokesman told reporters. “It’s vital that freedom of navigation is respected and observed. We are in contact with international partners and are ready to assist in any rescue effort or investigation.”
Samsung doesn’t release more than two major Android OS updates for its devices and doesn’t really keep flagship devices on the monthly release schedule for security updates beyond three years. That’s just the way it is and there’s no indication of this changing any time soon.With the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ now crossing that threshold, it’s no surprise that the company has shifted both of these devices to the quarterly cycle. That means both of these devices will no longer receive monthly security updates.No more monthly security updates for the Galaxy S8/S8+Samsung had been sending out monthly security updates for these handsets up till now, releasing one just last month which brought the April 2020 security patch. Given that the Galaxy S8/S8+ hit shelves on April 21, 2017, it has been a full three years since these devices were released.It was about time that Samsung shifted them from the monthly update cycle to the quarterly cycle, and it has done just that now. What does being on the quarterly schedule mean exactly? Samsung will simply bundle all of the security updates in one firmware update that’s going to be sent out once every quarter.There was obviously no question of the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ getting the Android 10 update. They have received the two major OS updates that they were entitled to. Going forward, these devices will only receive one update per quarter. No new features have been added to the devices for quite some time now anyway, so there’s no use expecting that the next update will bring anything other than the security patch.The Galaxy S8 Active is still on the monthly update cycle. It arrived in August 2017 so it still has a ways to go before hitting the three-year threshold after which it will also be relegated to the quarterly cycle.
PORT NECHES, Texas (Reuters) - Three workers were injured and residents of four towns were told to evacuate after explosions on Wednesday at a Texas petrochemical plant, the latest in a series of chemical plant accidents in the region.An early morning blast at a TPC Group complex in Port Neches, Texas, was followed by a series of secondary explosions that shattered windows and blew locked doors off their hinges.About 60,000 people within a four-mile (6.4 km) radius of the facility were ordered to leave after a distillation column blew up about at 2 p.m. (2000 GMT) It was uncertain when residents would be able to return, Jefferson County chief executive Jeff Branick said.Branick ordered the departures on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday out of fear heat from the fire would ignite petrochemical tanks at the site. Firefighters were spraying water on the spherical tanks containing butane and other fuels to keep them cool, officials said.The mandatory evacuation covers Port Neches and Groves, and portions of nearby Nederland and Port Arthur, Texas, officials said. State police would patrol the communities to prevent looting, Branick said.The plant sits on a 218-acre (88.22-hectare) site located about 90 miles (145 km) east of Houston. It processes petrochemicals used to make synthetic rubber and resins, and a gasoline additive. TPC is nestled among several other chemical complexes that were not affected by the flames.Peyton Keith, a TPC spokesman, said fire officials were determined to let the fire in a butadiene processing unit burn itself out, and were attempting to keep the flames from spreading. He could not say when the fire could be extinguished.A smoky plume visible from miles (km) away released volatile organic compounds that can lead to eye, nose and throat irritation, shortness of breath, headaches and nausea, pollution regulator Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) said. No impact to water was reported.Toby Baker, TCEQ executive director, criticized the “unacceptable trend of significant incidents” in the region and pledged to review the state’s compliance efforts.The fiery blast caused extensive damage to operations at the TPC site and followed other fires at petrochemical producers and storage facilities in Texas.A March blaze at chemical storage complex outside Houston burned for days and was followed a month later by another at a KMCO LLC plant northeast of Houston that killed one worker and injured a second. A fire at an Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) chemical plant in Baytown, Texas, in July injured 37.People more than 30 miles (48 km) away from the complex were shaken awake by the 1 a.m. CT (0700 GMT) explosion, sources familiar with the fire-fighting and rescue operations said.The blast collapsed a roof over the plant’s control room, sending workers fleeing, and damaged its fire-fighting system. The suppression system was restored later in the day, Keith said.Some homes close to the plant also sustained heavy damage, and police went door-to-door early in the morning to check if residents were injured, said the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office.One of the three injured workers was flown by helicopter to a Houston hospital. All three were treated and released, Keith said.The plant employs 175 people and routinely has 50 contract workers on site.“We cannot speak to the cause of the incident or the extent of damage,” the company said.TPC processes petrochemicals for use in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, nylon, resins, plastics and MBTE, a gasoline additive. The company supplies more than a third of the feedstock butadiene in North America, according to its website.“Right now, our focus is on protecting the safety of responders and the public, and minimizing any impact to the environment,” TPC Group said on its website.
The April 26 episode of Killing Eve saw Eve ramping up her efforts to solve Kenny’s death and a fan-favorite moment of her and Villanelle sharing a kiss. There was still bloodshed however, and the brush with death and its aftermath shook Carolyn—whether she cares to admit it or hide it.Moving into the May 3 episode, Eve is back to being afraid of Villanelle, but she’s dedicated to uncovering what Kenny was investigating and the details of his murder. Yet, more bad stuff awaits her.[Spoiler alert: This article contains spoilers for Killing Eve episode 4, “Still Got It.” Read at your own risk.]Niko is backNiko is settled in Poland with a new job delivering bread, and he seems happy hanging out at a bar and staying out of trouble. Back in London, Eve is restless. She’s been sleeping at the newspaper office, too scared to stay home with Villanelle out there.She and Mo are at the desk doing research when she receives a bakery delivery. It’s her birthday! Scared to open the box, she takes it to the roof, much to the chagrin of Kenny’s co-workers. She opens it, and it’s a cake shaped like a double decker bus. Of course, it’s from Villanelle.Bear comes up and sees that Eve is upset. He offers to let her stay at his place after telling her she can’t sneak around and camp out at the office anymore.At his house, they share a beer and swap stories about their life choices and feelings of self-loathing. It makes her feel better. At bedtime, she receives a late-night text from Niko; it’s a selfie.Eve takes a trip, Konstantin hires VillanelleEve and Mo make progress and come across a photo from 1974 in Russia. It proves Villanelle copied a similar killing style. Their progress is interrupted when Eve receives another text from Niko, but this time it’s an invitation to visit.She leaves the office immediately to go see him and arrives at the farm where she’s working. They’re about 500 feet apart, but she calls his name and he turns toward her.Konstantin is in Moscow to spy on his child at school and scoops her up to play hooky. She tells him off and calls him out about his job, saying he only works for himself. His daughter tells him she wants him to have a plan, an exit.They part ways and he visits the accountant’s widow (the victim from episode 3). She shares that her husband left a note about a load of missing money and some files. It piques Konstantin’s curiosity, and he asks about the files while instructing her to go somewhere safe. It’s a trick.Villanelle is alone in her villa baking a cake until Dasha comes knocking. She questions her about her trip to London, and all Villanelle admits is that she saw Konstantin.Dasha scolds her about getting caught up in nonsense so she doesn’t ruin her chances of upward mobility. Dasha has a message from the higher-ups. They want to meet with Villanelle to discuss a promotion, but in the meantime, she has to stay put.Villanelle decides to go shopping and Konstantin sneaks up on her. They go for a skyride and he shares what he’s found about her biological family. He promises to help, but only for something in return. He sends her to kill the widow.Niko isn’t really backVillanelle pretends to be the gardener and in a funny scene, gets the hiccups. The woman tries to help her by scaring her, and startled, Villanelle drops the shears.They play a game of running through the garden while trying to scare each other before the assassin strangles her with a hose. Another off-the-record kill.In London, Carolyn meets with her MI6 colleague and they agree she can get back to work. On the ride home, she notices Konstantin walking in her neighborhood.She suspects he went to her house, but her daughter denies anyone came to visit. She and a crying Geraldine share an exchange about Kenny, but Carolyn refuses to crack and says she’s doing more for Kenny than she knows.Toward the end, we see Dasha again, swimming laps and puffing on a cigarrette. A woman from The Twelve approaches her. During a poolside chat, she asks Dasha why Villanelle is still chasing after Eve.This is news to her, and Dasha offers to kill Eve. She’s advised not to and to drive a wedge in between the women instead.Things switch to Poland, and Dasha is in disguise as an old woman. We learn that in the opening scene of the episode, was in the bar with Niko, snatched his phone, and sent the selfie to Eve.It was a setup to frame Villanelle. When Eve arrives (from the earlier scene) to see Niko, Dasha sneaks up on him from behind and stabs him in the neck with a pitchfork. Eve is in shock, and so are we. His death is the wedge. 
Germany’s constitutional court has threatened to block fresh purchases of German bonds through the European Central Bank’s flagship stimulus programme, potentially weakening the bloc’s monetary policy response to the coronavirus crisis. The court on Tuesday ordered the German government and parliament to ensure the ECB carried out a “proportionality assessment” of its vast purchases of government debt to ensure their “economic and fiscal policy effects” did not outweigh its policy objectives, and threatened to block new bond-buying unless the ECB did so within three months. In recent weeks the central bank has vastly expanded its quantitative easing programme of bond-buying to mitigate the economic consequences of coronavirus. It has bought more than €2.2tn of public sector debt since launching quantitative easing in 2014 in an attempt to halt a slide in inflation. The bond-buying programme has long been controversial in Germany, where critics argue the central bank has exceeded its mandate by illegally financing governments and exposing taxpayers to potential losses. Ruling in a long-running case about the legality of the bond-buying, the court in Karlsruhe said the German government and parliament had “a duty to take active steps against” QE “in its current form”. The complainants — a group of about 1,750 people, led by German economists and law professors — first brought their case in 2015. They argued the ECB was straying into monetary financing of governments, which is illegal under the EU treaty. The case was referred to the European Court of Justice, which ruled in favour of the ECB in 2018, but it went back to the German constitutional court, which on Tuesday rebuffed part of the ECJ’s earlier ruling, calling it “untenable from a methodological perspective”. By setting aside the ECJ’s 2018 judgment, the Karlsruhe court raised serious questions about the even application of EU law across the bloc. German courts have over decades of jurisprudence qualified the supremacy of EU law; other national courts have also raised objections. “What was different with Germany was that it always made clear the [constitutional] court was prepared to step in and do something about it,” said Panos Koutrakos, professor of European law at London’s City University. “This is the first case where a German court says the European court has no jurisdiction.” The court laid out a long list of reasons why the ECB may have exceeded its mandate, but said it could not decide if the ECB had broken EU law without more information on how the central bank balanced the economic and fiscal impact of its actions against its monetary policy aims. “Unless the ECB provides documentation demonstrating that such balancing took place, and in what form, it is not possible to carry out an effective judicial review as to whether the ECB stayed within its mandate,” it said.The decision may open the door to legal challenges against the ECB’s new €750bn pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP). The court did not rule on PEPP but it said the earlier bond purchases were only acceptable because of a number of limits that had subsequently been eased under the new programme. The plaintiffs are expected to consider whether to bring a fresh case. “This is the big risk,” Vítor Constâncio, former vice-president of the ECB, said on Twitter, saying the court had made a “ridiculous distinction between monetary policy and economic policy”. “New court cases will come immediately in Germany against PEPP,” he warned. Richard McGuire, strategist at Rabobank, said: “This is another barrier to solidarity during the Covid crisis.” He added: “We knew there was a political hurdle to sharing the costs between eurozone members — now there’s a legal one too.”Clemens Fuest, head of the Ifo economic institute in Munich, said the German court’s dismissal of the earlier ECJ ruling “reads like a declaration of war”. The euro fell 0.7 per cent against the dollar — its lowest level in a week — and the spread between 10-year Italian and German borrowing costs — a key measure of country risk in the eurozone — widened by 0.2 percentage points to 2.5 per cent.Most observers had expected the court in Karlsruhe to grudgingly accept that the ECB’s purchases of government debt were legal, and the court said that it “did not find a violation of the prohibition of monetary financing of member state budgets”. It added: “The decision published today does not concern any financial assistance measures taken by the European Union or the ECB in the context of the current coronavirus crisis.” The ECB governing council met to discuss the ruling on Tuesday evening, and said afterwards it “remains fully committed to doing everything necessary within its mandate to ensure that inflation rises to levels consistent with its medium-term aim and that the monetary policy action taken in pursuit of the objective of maintaining price stability is transmitted to all parts of the economy and to all jurisdictions of the euro area”. Jens Weidmann, head of the Bundesbank, said the court ruling “highlights important features” of the ECB's sovereign bond-buying — a reference to its self-imposed limits — that he said “ensure a sufficient safety margin to monetary financing of governments”.  Mr Weidmann, who has been one of the leading critics of the ECB’s QE programme on its governing council, said: “I have indicated the importance of this margin in the past.” But he added he would “support efforts” by the ECB to explain the “proportionality of the programme”. Eric Mamer, spokesman for European Commission, said: “Notwithstanding the analysis of the detail of the German constitutional court’s decision today, we reaffirm the primacy of EU law and the fact that the rulings of the European Court of Justice are binding on all national courts.” Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister, said: “It appears that we must further deepen and intensify European co-operation, and today’s verdict strengthens us in our efforts to do this, because it concedes to the ECB the fundamental right to carry out such bond-buying programmes.” 
GALLUP, N.M. — All the roads into this city on the edge of the Navajo Nation are closed. The soldiers at the checkpoints have their orders: Outsiders must turn around and drive away.Cities across the country have closed down businesses and ordered residents to remain at home, but the threat of the coronavirus in Gallup became so serious last week that Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham invoked the state’s Riot Control Act to lock down the entire city. The downtown of shops, bars and Indian trading posts is now nearly deserted.“We’re scared to death, so this had to be done,” said Amber Nez, 27, a shoe store saleswoman and Navajo Nation citizen who lives in Gallup and is pregnant with her fourth child. “I only wonder why we didn’t do this sooner.”The lockdown comes as state and local authorities grapple with one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in the United States on the nearby Navajo Nation, the country’s largest Indian reservation, and a surge in detected cases in places near the reservation.As of Sunday, the Navajo Nation had reported a total of 2,373 cases and 73 confirmed deaths from the virus. With a rate of 46 deaths per 100,000 people, the tribal nation has a higher coronavirus death rate than every state in the country except New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts.While Gallup is not within the boundaries of the Navajo Nation, the city of 22,000 serves as a regional hub for the Navajo and nearby Native American pueblos. Many citizens of various tribal nations regularly drive into Gallup to buy food and other goods.The refusal to follow social distancing guidelines by some residents of Gallup and other so-called border towns near the reservation has emerged as a source of tension, as tribal authorities say the behavior is undermining their attempts to control the virus.The Gallup area had the third-highest rate of infection of any metropolitan area in the United States as of Sunday. Only the areas around New York City and Marion, Ohio, the site of a large prison cluster, had higher rates.McKinley County, which includes Gallup, now accounts for about 30 percent of all confirmed coronavirus cases in New Mexico, surpassing counties in the state with much larger populations.In addition to shutting down all roads into Gallup, including the exits off the interstate highway, the lockdown order directs the essential businesses that are still operating to close from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. Nonessential businesses remain entirely closed in Gallup, as they are in other parts of New Mexico.The order also prohibits residents from leaving their homes except for emergency or essential outings, and allows only two people in vehicles at a time.Soldiers from the New Mexico National Guard were stationed at some of the checkpoints into Gallup on Sunday. Dusty Francisco, a spokesman for the New Mexico State Police, said the agency had sent 32 officers to assist. Mayor Louis Bonaguidi, who requested the lockdown, said he understood that the ask was unusual. “However, the Covid-19 outbreak in the city of Gallup is a crisis of the highest order,” Mr. Bonaguidi said. “Immediate action is necessary.”Mr. Bonaguidi on Sunday requested an extension of the lockdown, and the governor has extended it until Thursday.Jonathan Nez, president of the Navajo Nation, said he fully supported the lockdown order. “We have many members of the Navajo Nation that reside in Gallup and many that travel in the area, and their health and safety is always our top priority,” Mr. Nez said.Before the lockdown, tribal leaders complained that their attempts to curb infections on the reservation by setting curfews and creating checkpoints were being undermined when Navajo citizens ventured into Gallup.Residents of Gallup also groused that many people were ignoring social distancing guidelines by crowding into vehicles and food stores.The riot control law invoked by the governor allows police to issue misdemeanor citations for first-time violators. Repeat offenders could face felony charges.Nora Meyers Sackett, a spokeswoman for Ms. Lujan Grisham, said that the governor’s legal advisers were not aware of the riot law being used before in the state.But state officials said they were responding to building concern about the potential for the virus to devastate Native American peoples. While New Mexico has largely succeeded in limiting the overall spread of the virus around much of the state, the transmission levels among Native Americans remain alarming.Native Americans account for 53 percent of New Mexico’s confirmed coronavirus cases, while making up about 11 percent of the state’s population. Epidemiologists list several contributing factors, including multiple generations living in single households on reservations and a shortage of running water, making basic hygiene difficult.The fight to curb the spread of the virus in Gallup comes at a time of anger over the Trump administration’s failure to distribute the billions of dollars in coronavirus relief allocated to tribes in the $2.2 trillion stimulus package.Tribes including the Navajo Nation are suing the Treasury Department over its decision to allow for-profit native corporations in Alaska, in which Native Alaskans hold shares, to access the federal relief. The suit argues that the decision effectively diminishes the pool of money available to tribes in their fight against the virus.While the tribes spar with the federal government, Gallup stands in contrast to some towns in New Mexico where elected officials are adopting defiant positions against social distancing measures. In the nearby town of Grants, also located near tribal nations in western New Mexico, the mayor openly defied Ms. Lujan Grisham last week by telling businesses to reopen. (The state Supreme Court has ordered the mayor, Martin Hicks, to obey the state orders.)Mr. Hicks has asserted that Navajos were to blame for spreading the virus, openly expressing an unsubstantiated position that seems to be gaining traction in towns near Native American reservations.“We didn’t take it to them, they brought it to us,” Mr. Hicks said in a telephone interview, without offering any proof. “So how are we going to spread it amongst them when they’re the ones that brought it to us?”Meanwhile, some in Gallup are fretting over the potential for increased transmission across the state line as businesses in nearby Arizona prepare to reopen.Linda Alonzo, the postmaster, said that the lockdown was “absolutely needed.”“You’d go into Walmart, the parking lot was full, people weren’t doing much distancing,” said Ms. Alonzo, who emphasized that she had not left her home since the lockdown began.“We needed something extreme,” she said, “and this was it.” 
The coronavirus was circulating in France as early as December, new evidence suggests.Doctors in France discovered that a patient who went to the hospital in late December with respiratory symptoms was positive for COVID-19, according to The Guardian. The man contracted the virus nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. But it's still not clear how the man was infected, as he wasn't traveling. Doctors also can't say whether or not the man was France's "patient zero." The doctors discovered the patient while testing samples taken in December and January from 24 patients  who had all tested negative for the flu. One of the samples, taken from a patient on Dec. 27, tested positive for COVID-19.The doctors had originally collected the samples to test for the flu using a polymerase chain reaction test — the same test used to detect the new coronavirus — which searches for bits of viral genetic material. The patient, a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, likely became infected sometime between Dec. 14 and Dec. 22, according to the BBC. He presented to the hospital with a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing on Dec. 27. He was sick for 15 days and had infected his two children, but not his wife, Dr. Yves Cohen, the head of resuscitation at the Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals in Paris told France's BFM TV on May 3. It's too early to know whether or not this patient was France's "patient zero," he added. The patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come in contact with those arriving from China, according to the BBC. It's possible that the  patient's wife had been infected first, perhaps asymptomatically, Cohen said. “All the negative PCRs for pneumonia must be tested again," Cohen said. "The virus was probably circulating.”The French government is now working to confirm this case and will investigate further if necessary, the French health ministry told the BBC.Such early missed cases could have occurred elsewhere around the world. In the U.S., a medical examiner-coroner recently found that two people who died in Santa Clara County in California on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 had been infected with the coronavirus, weeks before the first known deaths from the coronavirus in the U.S.The very first known case of the coronavirus in the world could have occurred in November, in a 55-year-old person in the Hubei province of China, according to a previous Live Science report. That's more than a month before doctors first noted a cluster of odd pneumonia cases in the area. Though the timeline of the pandemic remains muddy, it's becoming apparent that the virus was spreading long before health care workers detected it. 
LONDON — Explosions crippled two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday in what the United States called “unprovoked attacks” by Iran, raising alarms about immediate security and potential military conflict in a vital passageway for a third of the world’s petroleum.Iran called the accusations part of a campaign of American disinformation and “warmongering.”The explosions forced the crews of both vessels to evacuate and left at least one ablaze, and hours later the causes were still under investigation. Yet the backdrop of steeply rising threats between President Trump and Iranian leaders gave the stricken ships a grave significance even before the facts became clear.[Read: Operator says a ‘flying object’ struck one tanker, not a mine]By afternoon, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that American intelligence agencies had concluded Tehran was behind the disabling of both ships. He pointed to the weapons used, the expertise and resources required and the similarity to other recent attacks attributed to Iran.The most compelling evidence to support Mr. Pompeo’s claim was video footage released Thursday night by the United States Central Command. A military spokesman, Capt. Bill Urban, said the video showed an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps patrol boat pulling up alongside the Kokuka Courageous, one of the stricken ships, several hours after the initial explosion, and removing an unexploded limpet mine in broad daylight.Also on Thursday night, the United States military released two photographs of the ship’s hull, showing damage and what it said was likely the unexploded mine.“Taken as a whole, these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security,” Mr. Pompeo told a news conference in Washington.Senior American officials had already blamed Iran for similar attacks last month against four tankers on the same waterway. Iranian officials, who denied any involvement in those attacks, also rejected assertions they were behind the events on Thursday and said Iran had been framed.“Suspicious doesn’t begin to describe what likely transpired this morning,” Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister, wrote on Twitter. Mr. Pompeo, firing back at his news conference, said Mr. Zarif “may think this is funny, but no one else in the world does.”The Kokuka Courageous was about 20 miles off the Iranian coast when it transmitted an emergency call for help after an initial explosion. When the crew surveyed the damage from the first explosion, they saw a second unexploded mine attached to the hull and evacuated the ship, according to the American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive intelligence matter.The confrontation also played out at the United Nations in a meeting of the Security Council, where the acting United States ambassador, Jonathan Cohen, told other members that Iran was behind the attacks. Iran’s United Nations mission issued a statement afterward denouncing the “inflammatory remarks” by the American representative, calling them part of “another Iranophobic campaign” of disinformation.“The U.S. and its regional allies must stop warmongering and put an end to mischievous plots as well as false flag operations in the region,” the Iranian statement said.Earlier Thursday, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, expressed “deep concern” that the new episode might lead to a military escalation.[Read more about the narrow waterway that is the world’s most important oil route.]Besides its importance as a petroleum highway, the Persian Gulf also divides bitter and heavily armed rivals, with Iran on one side and the American-backed Arab monarchies of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on the other.The two sides have fought for years through surrogate forces in neighboring countries, including Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Bahrain. Saudi and Emirati forces have been battling directly for more than four years to roll back a takeover of Yemen by a faction aligned with Iran.Anxieties over the shared dependence on the vulnerable Persian Gulf shipping lanes have always been central to their animosities, and a commitment to guaranteeing the flow of oil through the same channels is behind the substantial American military presence in the region.Iranian officials on Thursday suggested the new attacks might be the product of an elaborate conspiracy by their enemies, seemingly pointing to American allies like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or Israel, which have long urged Washington to take a more muscular approach to Iran.But many analysts said there was a growing consensus in the West that Iran had been behind last month’s attacks, which took place near the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. And they argued that Iran appeared to be seeking to demonstrate it could imperil the world’s oil markets, but without leaving the kind of fingerprints that could trigger American military retaliation.“As long as there is significant ambiguity the attacks won’t produce a casus belli,” or cause for war, said Jack Watling, a researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London. “But Iran is demonstrating its capabilities. It is saying, ‘We can impose a cost on our adversaries in this confrontation, and it will be high.’”Crude oil prices rose more than 3 percent in response to the crippling of the two ships on Thursday, indirectly boosting Iran’s revenue as an oil producer.The initial White House response on Thursday was measured. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had been briefed and that the “U.S. government is providing assistance and will continue to assess the situation.”It was only a few hours later that Mr. Pompeo publicly blamed Iran.The escalation came against the backdrop of a visit to Iran by the prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, who was hoping to de-escalate tensions between Tehran and Washington and avert any “accidental clashes.”Mr. Abe was carrying a note from Mr. Trump to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader, who rebuffed the overture. “I do not see Trump as worthy of any message exchange, and I do not have any reply for him, now or in future,” Mr. Khamenei said Thursday after meeting with Mr. Abe, according to the ayatollah’s website.The animosity between Washington and Tehran began rising a year ago after President Trump withdrew the United States from a 2015 deal with international powers that limited Iran’s nuclear activity in exchange for eased economic sanctions on the country of 80 million people.Then, laying out sweeping demands for Iran to alter its policies toward the region, Mr. Trump in April ratcheted up the pressure by imposing severe sanctions aimed at cutting off Iran’s exports of oil, the lifeblood of the now-struggling Iranian economy. He also designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, a part of the military, as a terrorist group.In May, citing unspecified warnings of imminent Iranian attacks on American allies or interests, the Trump administration announced it was dispatching an aircraft carrier group to the Persian Gulf as a deterrent.“If Iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of Iran,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter last month. “Never threaten the United States again!”Iranian leaders, in response, have threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a potential Persian Gulf chokepoint. After complying with the nuclear pact for a year even after the American withdrawal, Iran has also raised the possibility of breaching the accord by taking initial steps to expand its supply of enriched uranium.Some Iranian allies around the region have stepped up their attacks on allies of Washington, fueling fears of a wider conflict. The Houthi faction in Yemen, which is backed by Iran, has launched attacks on Saudi oil pipelines and other targets, and this week a Houthi missile hit the arrivals hall of a Saudi airport, injuring 26 people, according to Saudi news reports.The attacks in May on the four tankers near Fujairah were relatively minor, causing only limited damage to the hulls. An international investigation presented to the United Nations later concluded that the damage was done by divers deployed from small “fast boats” who had placed limpet mines against the hulls.On a visit to the United Arab Emirates about two weeks ago, John R. Bolton, President Trump’s national security adviser, said Iran was “almost certainly” responsible. A few days later, Mr. Pompeo called the attacks “efforts by the Iranians to raise the price of crude oil.”The explosions that disabled the tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday were far more severe.Both took place around dawn, with distress calls at 6:12 a.m. and 7 a.m., according to a statement from the United States Fifth Fleet, which said the U.S.S. Bainbridge, a guided missile destroyer, was “rendering assistance.”A Norwegian company that owns one of the ships, the Front Altair, confirmed that it was on fire. The crews of both vessels — about 23 in one and 21 in the other — were evacuated in lifeboats.The owners and operators of both vessels described the incidents as deliberate attacks.The Front Altair, registered in the Marshall Islands, was chartered by the CPC Corporation, the Taiwanese oil company, to carry naphtha, a petroleum product, from the Emirati port of Ruwais to Kaohsiung, Taiwan.The Kokuka Courageous was carrying methanol, headed from the Saudi port of Al Jubail to Singapore. Yutaka Katada, the president of the ship’s operator, Kokuka Sangyo, told a news conference that its Filipino crew had abandoned ship in lifeboats after what he described as two attacks three hours apart.Shipping industry representatives underscored the channel’s critical importance. “Some 30 percent of the world’s crude oil passes through the Straits,” Paolo d’Amico, the chairman of the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners, said in a statement. “If the waters are becoming unsafe, the supply to the entire Western world could be at risk.”
A student in Iowa narrowly escaped drowning after he drove his car into a river, and managed to call for help by saying: "Siri, call 911!"18-year-old Gael Salcedo lost control of his truck as he drove across a bridge over the Winnebago River on Wednesday, which plunged into the water and began to sink.Salcedo said he tried to find his phone to call for help, but couldn't see it. Luckily he got help from his iPhone's voice assistant."I lost my phone and since I couldn't find it, I was like 'Hey Siri, call 911.' And once Siri called, that's when I found my phone finally," he told KIMT3 News.Salcedo's call was answered by firefighters from nearby Mason City, who helped him get out of the window and swim to the riverbank through the freezing water."You're going to have to walk out," Mason City Fire Department's Lieutenant Craig Warner said he told Mr Salcedo. "I'll be right there with you holding on every step of the way."Salcedo is a student at North Iowa Area Community College. The accident happened when he was on his way to class."I turned to the right and from there, everything just went blurry. I didn't know where I was going and then I just didn't know what to do. I was just thinking in my head 'I think I'm going to die,'" he said.Salcedo was treated for shock at a nearby hospital, but discharged after three hours. 
Lego seems to have been inspired by recent events to bring its own vision fo the truck of the future to the world – behold this bold design statement in all its glory. Clearly, Lego is having a go at Elon Musk  and the Tesla  Cybertruck that he unveiled last week – which was… divisive in its reception, to say the least.The Lego version is “guaranteed shatterproof,” Lego notes on Twitter, which is a jab at the failed demo wherein Musk had designer Franz von Holzhausen hurl a large metal ball at the driver and rear passenger windows of the Cybertruck, only to have them smash instantly upon contact. Musk has since said that this only happened because Holzhausen’s prior sledgehammer strikes to the driver door panel undermined the structure of the windows, but it was still highly memorable and memeable moment.Despite launch day hiccups and a lot of poking fun at its looks, Musk has said that so far, more than 250,000 customers have signed up and put down a refundable $100 deposit for the Cybertruck, so it’s garnering enough interest for at least that level of commitment.No word on Lego’s truck availability or pre-orders, but maybe they’ll challenge Ford to a truck duel, too.
The Jonas Brothers keep foisting bops upon us, and it’s only been a month or so since they made their comeback.They’re back once more with an exciting new single with a more laid-back vibe, which is rolling in like salty summer sea air. “Cool” is a breezy, summery anthem that’s exactly everything its title implies, and is sure to please JoBros fans around the globe.If you’re an ’80s baby or just a huge fan of that era, you’re going to absolutely love the Miami Vice-themed video, too. It’s a veritable smorgasbord of aerobic outfits, massive boomboxes, and plenty of cologne to top things off – because we all know that’s how they did it in the ’80s. Oh, and don’t forget the shoulder pads. Those are absolutely essential.“Damn it, I’m feeling so cool,” the brothers croon. Look, no one here is about to argue with you. We absolutely agree you are cool and would love to buy the “moves” that you’re bottling for a dollar or two. If only that meant we could be on the same level (there are levels to our love, you know.)This time, the Jonas wives and girlfriends don’t make appearances like they did in the “Sucker” video (arguably upstaging the brothers themselves), but at least one of them was immortalized in the song, which positively riddled with references to ’80s culture. It’s also got some fun nods to Game of Thrones (hi, Sophie Turner!) and rapper Post Malone. There’s even a little nod to Nick Jonas’s 2016 album Last Year Was Complicated in the same verse: “And now that we’ve made it, how complicated was last year?”Now JoBros fanatics can bump two different songs created by the brothers in the year 2019. What a time to be alive. After “Cool,” don’t forget to give “Sucker” some time on your favorite streaming platform.The post The Jonas Brothers Make Shoulder Pads ‘Cool’ Again With Breezy New Single appeared first on MTV.
Atlassian has a portfolio of developer tools like Bitbucket, Jira and Confluence. It also has a marketplace with thousands of add-ons. But what it lacked was a development platform to call its own. Today, that changed when the company announced the Forge platform.“Forge will empower developers to more easily build and run enterprise-ready cloud apps that integrate with Atlassian  products,” the company wrote in a blog post announcing the new tools.The platform consists of three main components. For starters, it’s providing a serverless Function as a Service (FaaS) for developers to build hosted applications on Forge without worrying about the underlying infrastructure resources required to run the applications. The tool is actually built on AWS Lambda, AWS’s FaaS.This should allow more developers to get involved because it strips away a layer of complexity around managing infrastructure. “A FaaS platform also lets us eliminate common pain points such as authentication, identity, scaling and tenancy,” the company wrote in the blog post.The tool kit also includes a UI component called Forge UI for building user interfaces on the web or devices. Forge UI uses a declarative language that should make it easier to build user interfaces, and as with the function layer, the idea here is to simplify the process for users. Atlassian will deal with all of the security involved in building a user interface, something that many developers struggle with.“By abstracting away the process of rendering the UI layer, Forge makes stronger guarantees about how apps present or transmit sensitive data, such as user-generated content and personally identifying information,” the company wrote.The final piece is a command line interface (CLI) called Forge CLI. The idea here is to build continuous delivery pipelines with Bitbucket and run them from the command line. If you put all three of these components together, you have a pretty comprehensive development environment with tools for building functionality and designing user interfaces, while managing operations from a command line.There are lots of platform service offerings out there, so Atlassian faces some competition here, but for developers who planned on building apps for the Atlassian marketplace, this set of tools could prove useful and help push more developers to join in.
Xiaomi,  the world’s fourth largest smartphone vendor, on Wednesday shared its earnings figures for the quarter that ended in September. While the results fell largely in line with analysts’ expectations, a drastic drop in the company’s growth underscores some of the struggles that handset makers are facing as they shift to services to make up for dwindling smartphone purchases globally.The Chinese electronics firm posted Q3 revenue of 53.7 billion yuan, or $7.65 billion, up 3.3% from 51.95 billion yuan ($7.39 billion) revenue it reported in Q2 and 5.5% rise since Q3 2018.This is largely in line with analysts’ estimated revenue of 53.74 billion yuan, per Refinitiv figures, but growth is slowing. As a point of comparison, in Q2, Xiaomi reported QoQ growth of 18.7% and YoY of 14.8%.Xiaomi said its adjusted profit in the aforementioned quarter was 3.5 billion yuan ($500 million), up from about 2.5 billion yuan a year ago. Gross profit during the period was 8.2 billion yuan ($1.17 billion), up 25.2% year-over-year.The company said its smartphone business revenue during Q3 stood at 32.3 billion yuan ($4.6 billion), down 7.8% year-over-year. The company, which shipped 32.1 million smartphone units during the period, blamed “downturn” in China’s smartphone market for the decline.Marketing research firm Canalys reported this month that China’s smartphone market shrank by 3% during Q3. Despite the slowdown, Xiaomi said its gross profit margin of smartphones segment had reached 9% — up from 8.1% and 3.3% in the previous quarters.Other than Huawei, which leads the handsets market in China, every other smartphone vendor has suffered a drop in their shipment volumes in the country, according to research firm Counterpoint.But for Xiaomi, this should technically not be a problem. Long before the company listed publicly last year, it has been boasting about its business model: how it makes little money from hardware and more and more from delivering ads and selling internet services.That internet services business is not growing fast enough, however, to be an engine for the overall company. It grew by 12.3% year-on-year to 5.3 billion yuan ($750 million) and 15% since last quarter. Either way, it accounts for only a fraction of smartphone business’ contribution to the bottomline.Furthermore, parts of that business are facing some other challenges: Advertisement revenue has been falling for more than two consecutive quarters, the company says.Xiaomi said two years ago that it will only ever make 5% profit from its hardware, something its executives told TechCrunch has been engraved in the company’s “constitution.” But the slow shift to making money off of internet services, while making less money from selling hardware, is one of the chief reasons why the company had an underwhelming IPO.Meanwhile, the user base of Xiaomi’s Android -based MIUI  software is growing. It had 292 million monthly active users as of September this year, up from 278.7 in June.In more promising signs, Xiaomi said its smart TV and Mi Box platforms had more than 3.2 million paid subscribers and revenue from its fintech business, a territory it entered only in recent quarters, had already reached 1 billion yuan ($140 million).But it’s hardware that continues to make up the biggest proportion of its revenues. The company, which is increasingly moving its gadgets and services beyond Chinese shores, said revenue from its international business grew 17.2 year-over-year to 26.1 billion yuan ($3.7 billion) in the third quarter — accounting for 48.7% of total revenue.Much of Xiaomi’s international success could be attributed to its dominance in India, the world’s second largest smartphone market. For last nine consecutive quarters, Xiaomi has been the top smartphone vendor in India, one of the rare markets where the appetite for handsets continues to grow. Of the 32 million smartphone units the company shipped in Q3, more than 12 million of those arrived in India, according to Counterpoint.In a statement, Xiaomi founder and chairman Lei Jun  said the company is hopeful that it will be able to further grow its revenues when 5G devices start to get traction. The company has plans to launch at least 10 5G-enabled smartphone models next year, he said. No word from him on what the company intends to do about its services ecosystem.
Algeria is pressing ahead with elections on Thursday despite almost 10 months of mass demonstrations against its political system, near blanket opposition from non-governmental organizations, and the expectation that millions of Algerians will decline to vote.On Dec 12. Algerians have the option to select one of five candidates approved by Algeria’s interim president Abdelkader Bensalah and his military backers. But Algeria’s popular protest movement known as Hirak—an Arabic word meaning mobilization—says these candidates all belong to the old guard, with ties to former president Abdulazziz Bouteflika’s regime.In office for almost two decades, Bouteflika, 82, was a leader in name only after suffering a debilitating stroke in 2013. In February, Bouteflika announced he would seek a fifth term in office. Appalled, millions took to the streets in mass protests demanding a total overhaul of the political system that has been in place since Algeria won independence from France in 1962. Bouteflika’s resignation in April did little to appease the popular movement, which saw the aging leader as a front for a shadowy network of politicians, military officials and business people who wield power over the country’s politics and finances.Algeria’s elections are taking place on Thursday against a backdrop of 42 consecutive weeks of protests. Here’s what to know.Why is Algeria holding elections now?Dec. 12 marks the third time this year Algeria has attempted to hold presidential elections. After Bouteflika resigned and elections slated for April were scrapped, a vote to elect his successor was meant to take place in July. That too was called off after Algeria’s constitutional court ruled out two candidates that had been put forward.The army regards an election as the only way to resolve Algeria’s political impasse and this month’s vote comes after Algeria’s military chief of staff urged the interim president to publish a decree allowing elections before the end of the year. While the chief of staff is a publicly recognizable figure, it is the military leaders behind him that are Algeria’s powerbrokers, according to Dalia Ghanem, a resident scholar at the Carnegie Middle East Center. “Under the guise of preserving the constitution, they have been steering the transition by imposing elections and have been using the judiciary to purge regime opponents and keep allies in line,” she wrote recently.Who are the candidates running in the elections?All five of the candidates the state has approved to run are men over 50 with ties to the Bouteflika era. The two frontrunners, Abdelmadjid Tebboune and Ali Benflis, served as prime ministers under Bouteflika. Algeria’s current Minister for Culture is a third contender, and a fourth, an Islamist who served as Minister for Tourism between 1997 and 1999. A televised debate between the five candidates—the first of its kind in Algeria—was held on Dec. 6, but elicited widespread mockery from Algerians on social media.Young Algerians have focused on statements from Bengrina, in particular, to highlight how absurd they consider the campaign. Central to his platform is a bid to end women’s celibacy, which he has said is “dangerously increasing.” Women would be much better off if they “discovered the joys of marriage,” even if that means being a third or fourth spouse, Bengrina has argued, according to Carnegie’s Ghanem.How many people are expected to vote?No foreign observers are in Algeria to monitor the vote but turnout is expected to be low. TNearly all Algerian political and civil organizations have declined to endorse any of the five candidates put forward and have urged people not to vote. Algerians living in France, the United Kingdom, and several cities across the United States have also rallied to discourage their fellow expatriates from voting. On Dec. 8, San Francisco-based Algerians claimed that only 14 of some 3,000 people the electoral roll there had cast a vote.Despite that, last month marches organized by the General Union of Algerian Workers (UGTA) intended to show solidarity with the government mustered more than 10,000 people to the streets across several cities in Algeria, Reuters reports.How have Algerian authorities responded to the protests?From the outset, Hirak has been characterized by its staunch commitment to peaceful protest f. Still, Algeria has increasingly clamped down on dissent in the run-up to elections, arresting and detaining hundreds. Since the campaign officially opened on November 17, at least eight protesters have been convicted and imprisoned and 15 others are in pre-trial detention on vague charges, Human Rights Watch reports. In August, police detained Human Rights Watch representative Ahmed Benchemsi while he was observing pro-democracy protests in Algiers, eventually deporting him from the country.What will the result mean for Algeria?It may depend on how many people show up to vote. Protesters have vowed to continue their demonstrations no matter who is elected on Dec. 12, but a very low turnout would make it near-impossible for Bouteflika’s successor to assert his legitimacy. That could ultimately galvanize the Hirak to force a political upheaval. It could also prompt the military to intervene and put down the popular movement.
WASHINGTON – A top Pentagon official for nuclear defense sexually harassed three women on his staff and resigned as an investigation substantiated the charges against him, the Defense Department inspector general reported Thursday. Guy Roberts, who had served as the assistant Defense secretary for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs, resigned on April 2 amid a probe into allegations from three women on his staff that he had forced hugs and kisses on them and told inappropriate jokes. The inspector general's investigation began Feb. 22.One woman told investigators that shortly after she began working for Roberts, he routinely greeted her by hugging and kissing her and would "press his crotch and chest against her in an attempt to have full body contact." She showed investigators how she tried to squirm out of his unwanted embraces.Roberts, in a written response, refuted the allegations.“I am surprised and dismayed by the conclusions contained in the report," Roberts wrote. "Specifically, that I sexually harassed and inappropriately touched the three employees and others."Military: Sexual assault, harassment spikes at military academies, strategies fail to stem crisisRoberts acknowledged telling inappropriate jokes but said he had done so for decades and relied on his staff to keep him in line."I have been telling those jokes and funny incidents for over 30 years to audiences large and small," Roberts wrote. "In today's work place the fact that any one person would feel uncomfortable is enough to stop telling those kinds of jokes and I failed to appreciate that fact."Among the inspector general's findings:Roberts frequently hugged the women, touched them, and made sexual comments. Roberts made jokes that many found inappropriate and offensive and which caused employees to feel uncomfortable.Roberts treated women on his staff differently than men and made deliberate, unwelcome physical contact of a sexual nature by hugging, kissing, or touching the three women.Roberts' physical contact and statements caused the three women to fear damage to their professional reputations.The first woman, a part-time employee, told investigators she changed the way she dressed and sought to avoid Roberts' attention."She stated: 'I just, I wanted him to stop paying attention to me, and I wanted him to think I wasn't attractive. I mean I consciously thought about what I was wearing and how I was behaving. It was awful. I mean it was bad. It was really uncomfortable,'" the report notes.The inspector general interviewed Roberts and 18 witnesses during the investigation and reviewed more than 4,000 emails.He regularly told jokes in public about sexual prowess, erections and buttocks that Pentagon staffers found inappropriate, according to the report.Roberts' actions, according to the inspector general, created an intimidating, hostile, and offensive work environment for the three women. Prior to taking his nuclear defense post as a political appointee, Roberts had been a career Marine officer as an infantryman and as a lawyer.In 2018, the Pentagon inspector general announced it had substantiated 590 allegations of misconduct among generals, admirals and senior civilian officials from 2013 to 2017 with trends showing a decline in misbehavior. But the overall number of complaints against senior officials has more than doubled since 2008. Investigators received 395 complaints in 2008 against generals, admirals and senior civilians. In 2017, there were 803 complaints. 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democrat from Michigan, said in an interview Sunday that she knows Joe Biden and the sexual assault allegation leveled against him is not “consistent with” the person she knows.Whitmer, who is reportedly on a shortlist of potential vice president picks for the former Delaware senator, joined other Democrats like Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, who have all come out in support of Biden.“Just because you’re a survivor doesn’t mean that every claim is equal,” she told CNN. “It means we give them the ability to make their case, and the other side as well, and then to make a judgment that is informed.”Whitmer has been clashing with Republicans in her state over coronavirus lockdown orders that some claim is too extreme. The state has seen protests, including one on Thursday that stormed Michigan’s Capitol building.Biden has been accused by a former aide of sex assault dating back to the 90s. Biden has denied the charge.Reade told the Associated Press she filed a limited report with a congressional personnel office that did not explicitly accuse him of sexual assault or harassment.“I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,” Reade said in an interview Friday with the AP. “I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.”
Nicolás Maduro, the embattled leader of Venezuela, said Monday that authorities in Caracas captured 13 “terrorists” – including two U.S. citizens – in a failed invasion attempt that he said was no doubt orchestrated by the Trump administration.In a nationwide broadcast appearance on state television, Maduro held up two U.S. passports that he said had been recovered during the attempted raid. He read off the names and birthdays of the two Americans.“They were playing Rambo,” he said, according to The Guardian. “They were playing hero.”The two U.S. citizens were identified as Luke Denman and Airan Berry, both former U.S. special forces soldiers. Video emerged that purported to show Venezuelan authorities with their captives lined up at a seaside marina.Maduro said the U.S. government is “fully and completely involved in this defeated raid," The Associated Press reported. He praised citizens from a fishing community for cornering one of the groups he described as “professional American mercenaries.”The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News. The Washington Post reported that U.S. officials and Juan Guaidó, the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, denied any involvement with the action called “Operation Gideon.”The Guardian reported that Guaidó’s team denied any connection to Florida-based ex-Green Beret Jordan Goudreau who said earlier Monday that his mission intended to detain Maduro and “liberate” Venezuela. Goudreau has claimed responsibility for the operation. The AP reported earlier that Goudreau was working with a retired Venezuelan army general facing U.S. narcotics charges along with other defectors. The report said the makeshift army of about 60 lacked U.S. support.Venezuela and the United States broke diplomatic ties last year amid heightened tensions, so there is no U.S. embassy in Caracas.Goudreau said earlier Monday that he was working with the two men who served in Iraq and Afghanistan with him in the U.S. military. He told The Washington Post that he has been in touch with a lawyer in Venezuela and has been reaching out to the State Department. He called on the U.S. to retrieve the captured men.“They are Americans,” he said. “They are ex-Green Berets. Come on."Kay Denman, the mother of one of the Americans, told the AP the last time she heard from her son was a few weeks ago, when he texted her from an undisclosed location to ask how she was coping with the coronavirus pandemic. She said she never heard her son discuss Venezuela and only learned of his possible capture there after his friends called when they saw the reports on social media.“The first time I heard Jordan Goudreau’s name was today,” she said when reached at her home in Austin, Texas.  
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday the House would act next week to wrap up its impeachment inquiry, following up on whatever decision is taken on articles of impeachment by the House Judiciary Committee this week.“Next week we’ll take up something,” Pelosi told reporters as she discussed the timetable for the impeachment inquiry launched by Democrats.
Over the last few weeks many of us have been stunned by the sight of Starlink satellites.Lots of people have stayed up specifically to catch a glimpse of the dazzling lights passing through the sky during the lockdown period.And the formations are due to be visible again over the coming days.Comprised of thousands of tiny satellites the formations look like stars moving across the night sky – like a train.The technology is used across the globe to provide remote locations with low-cast internet and are the latest to be launched by entrepreneur Elon Musk's company - SpaceX.But they might well become a relatively common sight in the skies above the UK in the future as SpaceX have been granted 12,000 satellites as part of the project - a number which could eventually increase to 30,000.When will I be able to see the Starlink satellites?According to Findastarlink.com, the formations will be visible on multiple occasions in the UK over the next few days.Here’s when they say the best times are to catch them over the north-east of England.May 411:01 pm Starlink-3 will be visible flying over the UK skies for six minutes travelling west to east.May 510:02 pm Starlink-3 will be visible flying over the UK skies for five minutes travelling southwest to east.May 610:38 pm Starlink-3 will be visible flying over the UK skies for six minutes travelling west to east.May 79:38 pm Starlink-3 will be visible flying over the UK skies for six minutes travelling southwest to east. 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will likely meet on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit later this month in Japan, a White House spokesman said on Thursday, although he suggested a meeting was not yet firmly scheduled.“It looks like we’re moving in that direction,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told Fox News Channel when asked if the two leaders would have a bilateral meeting.Trump has repeatedly said he expects to meet Xi at the G20 gathering to talk about the trade dispute between the two nations.
NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Global stocks rose to a fresh six-month high on Friday as U.S. labor market data eased concerns about an economic slowdown, while optimism that a trade deal between the United States and China was drawing closer also lifted sentiment.After outsized results some analysts saw as distorted by the partial government shutdown in the prior two months, data showed U.S. employment growth accelerated from a 17-month low in March, buoyed by milder weather.U.S. short-term interest-rate futures held on to earlier slight losses after the data, as contracts tied to the Federal Reserve’s policy rate continue to price in a little less than a 50 percent chance of an interest rate cut by year’s end, and a little more than even odds for a cut early next year.“We are certainly seeing lots of green shoots in the economy, especially service PMIs, employment numbers; the consumer is a really strong driver of this economy and GDP is inching up,” said Janet Johnston, portfolio manager at TrimTabs Asset Management in New York.“We are seeing a disconnect between the stock and the bond markets that the bond market thinks we are going to have a recession and the stock market is acting like the worst is over.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.55 points, or 0.11%, to 26,413.18, the S&P 500 gained 11.47 points, or 0.40%, to 2,890.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 42.96 points, or 0.54%, to 7,934.74.The S&P 500 was on pace for a seventh straight day of gains.U.S. and Chinese trade negotiators will continue talks next week by video conference as they try to reach a deal to resolve the trade war, White House adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday.The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.09%, notching its best weekly performance in three weeks, and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.29% and was poised for a second straight weekly gain.Better-than-expected data out of Germany, along with the U.S. jobs report, and a possibly delayed British departure from the European Union also helped boost risk appetite for European shares.German industrial output rose 0.7% in February as mild weather helped a surge in construction activity, although manufacturing production slipped.U.S. Treasury yields dipped, with the yield curve US2US10-TWEB flattening, as investors who took a gloomier view of the March U.S. payrolls report stepped into the market, buying longer-dated Treasuries.Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.5061%, from 2.51% late on Thursday.President Donald Trump said on Friday the Fed should lower rates, noting the jobs numbers showed the economy had performed well but adding that action by the U.S. central bank had really slowed down the economy.In currencies, the dollar moved slowly higher, on track for a third straight week of gains against a basket of major currencies. The dollar index rose 0.1%, with the euro down 0.07% to $1.1212.

At the very beginning, there were 14 startups. After two days of incredibly fierce competition, we now have a winner.Startups participating in the Startup Battlefield have all been hand-picked to participate in our highly competitive startup competition. They all presented in front of multiple groups of VCs and tech leaders serving as judges for a chance to win $50,000 and the coveted Disrupt Cup.After hours of deliberations, TechCrunch editors pored over the judges’ notes and narrowed the list down to five finalists: Gmelius, Hawa Dawa, Inovat, Scaled Robotics and Stable.These startups made their way to the finale to demo in front of our final panel of judges, which included: Andrei Brasoveanu (Accel), Andrew Reed (Sequoia Capital), Carolina Brochado (SoftBank Vision Fund), Lila Preston (Generation Investment Management) and Mike Butcher (TechCrunch).Winner: Scaled RoboticsScaled Robotics has designed a robot that can produce 3D progress maps of construction sites in minutes, precise enough to detect that a beam is just a centimeter or two off. Supervisors can then use the software to check things like which pieces are in place on which floor, whether they have been placed within the required tolerances or if there are safety issues like too much detritus on the ground in work areas.Read more about Scaled Robotics in our separate post.Runner-up: StableStable offers a solution as simple as car insurance, designed to protect farmers around the world from pricing volatility. Through the startup, food buyers ranging from owners of a small smoothie shop to Coca-Cola employees can insure thousands of agricultural commodities, as well as packaging and energy products.Read more about Stable in our separate post.
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that it was too early to draw any conclusions on attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman because of the lack of information.“No one knows what is behind it,” he said.Two oil tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday, leaving one ablaze and both adrift, shipping firms said, driving oil prices as much as 4% higher over worries about Middle East supplies.
Premier League matches could last less than 90 minutes when the season resumes, according to PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor.Top-flight officials are considering a number of measures to improve the safety of players and staff amid the coronavirus crisis, including neutral venues and extra substitutes in every game.And now Taylor has claimed that another radical proposal to shorten each half is on the table ahead of showdown talks on Project Restart.'We don't know the future, what we do know is what propositions have been put forward and ideas. More subs, games possibly not being full 45 minutes each way, neutral stadiums, there's lots of things put forward.'We're trying to wait to see what the proposals are and have the courtesy to let the managers and coaches and players assimilate all those and come to a considered view.' Questioned on whether the idea of having more substitutes would negate the need to shorten matches, Taylor added: 'There's a lot of possibilities. Ideally you want to keep the integrity of the competition and of course that was about playing home and away, that's about having the same squad of players before it was suspended.'There's lots of points to be made, but above all can the seasons be completed, as long as it takes, and above all can it be completed safely.'On the prospect of games being shortened, EFL chief Rick Parry said on Tuesday that there hadn't been any specific discussions about it that he was aware of.Speaking via videolink to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee he said: 'Talks have been held on increasing subs to five, the aim (of shortening matches) could only be to reduce the strain on the players, who are coming abck after a fairly long time away. I don’t think we should be ruling out any creative ideas at the momemt, I haven’t heard that one before but no reason it should not be added to things to disucss. 'We would have a crammed fixture schedule so perhaps the thinking is that it would alleviate the tiredness, help with recovery and lessen likelihood of injuries. I guess that is what Gordon’s thinking was but we haven’t studied it.'Last week, Sergio Aguero revealed that he and the 'majority' of players are scared about returning to action too early and putting their friends and family at risk.Asked what he thought about the Manchester City star's comments and whether the players he represents had a right to be afraid, Taylor, 75, said: 'Sergio is a top-class player and he is entitled to his opinion. 'It's not a question of being scared, it's a question about being fully informed for the relevant authorities to ensure it's as safe as it can be to return and to pick out any particular statements or choose any parts of that process. It's not fair until you look at the whole menu.'Are you trying to say my players are frightened to return? They're professional sportsmen and women, and of course they're concerned about their own safety, they're not stupid and not naive so they would have to be satisfied it's safe to return and it's their choice.'Taylor, who denied that teams involved in the relegation battle want the current season to be cancelled, insists that a return to action in June remains the target. 'The very fact that you're in a professional sport, you need to be very resilient and bounce back because you'll get more setbacks,' he added.'I like to think that's how my members are. It remains in process and we will wait and see and take it on a day-by-day basis and see if it's achievable but if we don't try then it's never going to be achievable. 'If everything looks promising, you wouldn't be thinking of matches being played middle of June, I would estimate.' 
Teachers could be advised they have the right not to attend work under health and safety legislation if they do not feel it is safe to return to school, i understands.The Government is believed to be targeting 1 June to start the return to school in England. The decision is expected to be confirmed by Boris Johnson on Sunday.Year 6 pupils are expected to be the first group of children to return to school, but some teachers and school leaders are sceptical about reopening classes on that date.Ten and 11-year-old pupils in Year 6 of primary school are expected to be the first cohort going back, with secondary school students in Years 10 and 12 to follow.School transitionIf schools are reopened without the profession being on board, then education unions will not be able to encourage teachers to stay at home because they could leave themselves open to accusations of backing illegal strikes. However, it is understood that teachers could be reminded of Section 44 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which protects an employee’s right to withdraw from a workplace if they believe it is unsafe.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: "The overriding concern is that any decision is underpinned by public health and scientific advice that the timing is right, and that there is clear guidance to schools and colleges on the measures which will need to be put in place to protect staff and pupils from the risk of infection. It will be necessary to build confidence that it is safe to return to schools, because otherwise parents will vote with their feet, and they will not send their children to school."For all these reasons, we would urge that any date is kept under review, and that if more time is needed then the date is changed accordingly."The NASUWT teaching union has said the Government needs to give “clarity about the purpose of reopening schools”, and schools need “much more detail and sufficient time to enable them to prepare”.Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union - the UK’s biggest teaching union - accused the Government of a lack of transparency in developing its plans.“It would be really great if they could come clean with us about what their plans are,” she told i. Dr Bousted said mixed messages on when and how schools will reopen had been “damaging and really unhelpful”, and “as a public relations strategy it seems to me to be wholly counterproductive.”She said her union had repeatedly pressed the Government to share the latest scientific evidence about children’s role in spreading Covid-19, along with current thinking about how to mitigate the spread, to no avail.“Schools aren’t built for social distancing, nor is our education system built for not having lots of contact with kids,” she said. “There are massive questions around cleaning, around personal protective equipment, and around the science, and we haven’t had answers to those yet.”Dr Bousted said the NEU wanted schools to reopen but the union needed to know “what the risks are and what the mitigation of those risks are”.'Important milestone'Cathie Paine, the deputy chief executive of Reach2, the largest primary school chain in England, told i that starting with Year 6 pupils made sense.“It’s absolutely essential that we stem any loss of learning in this crucial year for pupils and support them as best we can in their move to secondary school," she said. "Leaving primary school is a really important milestone, and so the lovely benefit of having Year 6s back in school means that we can also properly celebrate their last weeks in primary before they take that exciting next step. But of course, all of this must only be done if we can be confident of the safety of our children and our staff.”Dan Morrow, the chief executive of the Woodland Academies Trust - which runs four primary schools in London and north Kent - told i that practising social distancing with Year 6 pupils would be “potentially easier” than younger years.However, he questioned whether they were the right pupils to prioritise for return. “Are we trying to achieve an important goodbye to primary?... The vast majority of saying goodbye to primary doesn’t really involve social distancing, it involves lots of hugs, signing shirts, the production.“The absolute glory of the end of Year 6 is somewhat smashed by the social distancing rules.”He added: “It’s possibly not about year groups, it’s about characteristics and context and so for me, it’s more important that we’re getting [back] those children who have got speech and language delays, or who are in circumstances that are more challenging around their wellbeing.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has not set a date for schools reopening.“Schools will remain closed, except for children of critical workers and vulnerable children, until the scientific advice indicates it is the right time to re-open and the five tests set out by Government to beat this virus have been met.”“We are also working closely with the sector as we consider how to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges and will ensure everyone has sufficient notice to plan and prepare.” 
Michael Jordan knew he had screwed up right away.During a Chicago Bulls practice in 1995, Jordan got into a fight with guard Steve Kerr.Earlier this week, Kerr shared his side of the reconciliation between the two players, but Sunday, we got Jordan's side."So I go down to the locker room, and Michael says, 'I know, I lost it for a second,' " then-Bulls coach Phil Jackson said during episode No. 8 of ESPN's "The Last Dance" documentary."I'm in the shower, and I'm saying, 'Look, I just beat up the littlest guy on the f-----g court,' " Jordan said. "And I felt about this small. So when I get in the car, and I call back to the United Center, I said, 'Please give me Steve Kerr's number.' I call Steve and I apologize, and I said 'Look man, it had nothing to do with you. I feel bad.' "That phone call fixed everything between Jordan and Kerr."We talked it out, and it was probably, in a weird way, the best thing that I ever did, was stand up for myself with him because he tested everybody he played with, and I stood up to him," Kerr said on "The Last Dance."Kerr punched Jordan, but his actions won over the best player in NBA history."He earned my respect because he wasn't willing to back down to be a pawn in this whole process," Jordan said.[RELATED: Kerr self-conscious about fight]As Kerr has said all week when recounting the infamous fight, the incident brought them closer together."From that point on, our relationship dramatically improved and our trust in each other, everything, it was like 'All right, we got that out of the way, we're going to war together,' " Kerr said.They would go on to win three NBA titles together with the Bulls, and the trust that had been built led to Jordan feeding Kerr for the 1997 NBA Finals-winning shot.
Target Circle and TapHeaven announced they’re merging into a single company under the Target Circle brand.TapHeaven  co-founder and CEO Chris Hoyt, who is becoming chief growth officer at the combined organization, said the two companies have been “trying to solve the same problem” — namely, eliminating many of the inefficiencies in the mobile advertising business.Hoyt said that for Target Circle,  that meant trying to “unify this fragmented ecosystem into a single dashboard for contracts, invoices and offers.” And for TapHeaven, that meant a focus on automation, resulting in the launch of what the company calls a “command center” for user acquisition, where advertisers can optimize their ad campaigns “at the source level, by country” while getting high-quality traffic without fraud.The companies also complement each other geographically — Target Circle is headquartered in Oslo, Norway, while TapHeaven is headquartered in San Francisco.According to Hoyt, they first came across each other because they were talking to the same mobile studio about supporting the launch of a new game, and it became clear they “both had the same vision for our businesses, the same future with a unified dashboard wrapped in automation and machine learning to simplify and help the ecosystem perform for these advertisers.”Target Circle founder and CEO Heiko Hildebrandt will continue to serve as chief executive for the combined companies — in the announcement, he said TapHeaven allows the company to “strengthen and expand its technology in the automation of advertising and fraud prevention and resolution.” Meanwhile, TapHeaven executives Brian Krebs and Jeremy Jones will become CIO and chief of user experience, respectively.The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Moving forward, Hoyt said Target Circle will continue to support its existing products while focusing on the new UA Command Center as “the future of our business.” He also suggested that the platform could help advertisers move away from Facebook and Google, allowing them to get the performance they need from other ad networks.“What impact this is going to have on the market is really lifting up the rest of the ecosystem,” he said. “I feel like Facebook and Google have had their day, a little bit … With the serious things that are going on with these companies, advertisers are desperate for the answers to where [else] can they spend their money and diversify their portfolio.”
Whatever you choose to call them, these monster storms are powerful natural events with the capacity to wreak incredible havoc.As Cyclone Vayu rages in the Indian ocean, you may be wondering what a cyclone even is. But if you've ever survived a hurricane or typhoon, you already know the answer.TODAY’SPOPULAR STORIESHISTORY11,000-year-old mine in underwater cave surprises archaeologistsSCIENCESome trees may 'social distance' to avoid diseaseSCIENCECoronavirus in the U.S.: Where cases are growing and decliningThat's because hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons are all the same weather phenomenon. Scientists just call these storms different things depending on where they occur.In the Atlantic and northern Pacific, the storms are called "hurricanes," after the Caribbean god of evil, named Hurrican.In the northwestern Pacific, the same powerful storms are called "typhoons." In the southeastern Indian Ocean and southwestern Pacific, they are called "severe tropical cyclones."In the northern Indian Ocean, they're called "severe cyclonic storms." In the southwestern Indian Ocean, they're just "tropical cyclones."To be classified as a hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone, a storm must reach wind speeds of at least 74 miles per hour (119 kilometers per hour).If a hurricane's winds reach speeds of 111 miles per hour (179 kilometers per hour), it is upgraded to an "intense hurricane."If a typhoon hits 150 miles per hour (241 kilometers per hour) then it becomes a "supertyphoon."Different seasonsWhile the Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30, the typhoon and cyclone seasons follow slightly different patterns. In the northeastern Pacific, the official season runs from May 15 to November 30. In the northwestern Pacific, typhoons are most common from late June through December. And the northern Indian Ocean sees cyclones from April to December.Whatever you choose call them, these monster storms are powerful natural events with the capacity to wreak some serious havoc.According to NOAA's National Hurricane Center, the average hurricane eye—the still center where pressure is lowest and air temperature is highest—stretches 30 miles (48 kilometers) across, with some growing as large as 120 miles (200 kilometers) wide.The strongest storms, equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, have sustained winds that exceed 155 miles per hour (250 kilometers per hour).In the northeastern Pacific, the official season runs from May 15 to November 30.

If Nintendo won't do it, modders will: Mario 64 has been ported to the PC with full native 4K resolution support, ultra-wide monitor support, and ultra-smooth animationsRemember when 64 bits and polygons were all the rage? Now that classic era has been reborn in high-end PCs, and skilled modders have successfully ported Mario 64 onto PC with Unreal Engine 4. This isn't emulation like the Super Mario Odyssey 64 mod, but a literal native port that uses reverse-engineered decompiled code from the N64 game. The project was built in Unreal Engine 4 with DirectX 12 support, which allows for high resolutions like 3840 x 2160, support for 21:9 aspect ratios, and compatibility with other graphics overhaul mods and shaders. The results are smooth animations, high-def textures and graphics (even if they're polygonal), and a generally all-around improved experience. If Nintendo officially released Mario 64 on PC, it'd look and play something like this. The Mario 64 PC port will be a huge template for modders everywhere. It's basically the entry point to crazy off-the-wall creations, complete with native DX12 support. This will make it far easier for creators to make and import assets and content into the pipelines for new unique mods. Nintendo probably isn't happy about this one bit and we could see some actions taken by the billion-dollar console titan.   
New York (CNN Business)One week ago Joe Crain, the morning meteorologist at WICS in Springfield, Illinois, called out station management for mandating over-the-top "Code Red" weather alerts.Now Crain is officially out of a job.A spokesman for the station's parent, Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI), confirmed Wednesday night that "Joe was let go."The company declined to comment further to CNN Business.But Crain's exit caps a week of controversy for the station and its parent company, which has repeatedly come under scrutiny for its editorial choices.Crain's June 5 commentary about the station's "Code Red" warnings went viral — much to the dismay of Sinclair executives."We want you to know it's not us," Crain told viewers, blaming "corporate" for the frightening alerts.Crain was noticeably absent from the station's airwaves after his monologue. Viewers and advertisers supported him en masse, with many expressing concern that he might lose his job. One week later, "people are still livid" in the community, a Sinclair source said on Wednesday.WICS tried to assuage the concerns by dropping the "Code Red" branding and replacing it with "Weather Warn," the same jargon that other Sinclair stations use. The change was announced on Monday.Crain has declined to comment on his status, and he did not respond to a request for comment after Sinclair confirmed his departure on Wednesday evening.But the writing was on the proverbial wall when Sinclair posted a job listing for a WICS morning meteorologist on Tuesday.
Former Boston Red Sox right-hander Rick Porcello has agreed to a one-year, $10 million deal with the New York Mets, a source told ESPN, confirming multiple reports.Porcello, who turns 31 on Dec. 27, had multiyear offers but preferred a one-year deal, according to reports.A ground ball pitcher who relies on a sinking, two-seam fastball, Porcello is coming off a career-worst season with the Red Sox. He was 14-12 but had a 5.52 ERA that was the highest in the majors.He has been quite durable over the past four seasons, making at least 32 starts per year, but the velocity on his slider dropped by 1.7 mph from 2018, which made the pitch far less effective. He gave up a troublesome .314/.407/.571 slash line with runners in scoring position in 2019.He signed a four-year, $82.5 million contract extension with the Red Sox in 2015. In his five seasons with Boston, he had one great season -- winning the American League Cy Young Award in 2016, when he was also voted Comeback Player of the Year.Porcello led the majors with 22 wins in 2016 and had career-bests in innings pitched (223), strikeouts (189), ERA (3.15) and WHIP (1.01). He allowed only 32 walks over the entire season and threw three complete games.In 11 seasons with the Red Sox and Detroit Tigers, Porcello has a 149-118 record and a 4.36 ERA.
In a brilliant dance, a cornucopia of flowers, pinecones and acorns connected by wind, rain, insects and animals ensure the reproductive future of seed plants. But before plants achieved these elaborate specializations for sex, they went through millions of years of evolution. Now, researchers have captured a glimpse of that evolutionary process with the discovery of a new ancient plant species.The fossilized specimen likely belongs to the herbaceous barinophytes, an unusual extinct group of plants that may be related to clubmosses, and is one of the most comprehensive examples of a seemingly intermediate stage of plant reproductive biology. The new species, which is about 400 million years old and from the Early Devonian period, produced a spectrum of spore sizes -- a precursor to the specialized strategies of land plants that span the world's habitats. The research was published in Current Biology May 4."Usually when we see heterosporous plants appear in the fossil record, they just sort of pop into existence," said the study's senior author, Andrew Leslie, an assistant professor of geological sciences at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth). "We think this may be kind of a snapshot of this very rarely witnessed transition period in evolutionary history where you see high variation amongst spores in the reproductive structure."A major shiftOne of the most important time periods for the evolution of land plants, the Devonian witnessed diversification from small mosses to towering complex forests. The development of different spore sizes, or heterospory, represents a major modification to control reproduction -- a feature that later evolved into small and large versions of these reproductive units."Think of all the different types of sexual systems that are in flowers -- all of that is predicated on having separate small spores, or pollen, and big spores, which are inside the seeds," Leslie said. "With two discrete size classes, it's a more efficient way of packaging resources because the big spores can't move as easily as the little ones, but can better nourish offspring."The earliest plants, from between 475 million to 400 million years ago, lacked reproductive specialization in the sense that they made the same types of spores, which would then grow into little plantlets that actually transferred reproductive cells. By partitioning reproductive resources, plants assumed more control over reproduction, according to the researchers.The new species, together with the previously described plant group Chaleuria of the same age, represents the first evidence of more advanced reproductive biology in land plants. The next example doesn't appear in the fossil record until about 20 million years later."These kinds of fossils help us locate when and how exactly plants achieved that kind of partitioning of their reproductive resources," Leslie said. "The very end of that evolutionary history of specialization is something like a flower."A fortuitous findThe researchers began analyses of the fossils after they had been stored in the collections at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History for decades. From about 30 small chips of rock originally excavated from the Campbellton Formation of New Brunswick in Canada by late paleobotanist and study co-author Francis Hueber, they identified more than 80 reproductive structures, or sporangia. The spores themselves range from about 70 to 200 microns in diameter -- about a strand to two strands of hair. While some of the structures contained exclusively large or small spores, others held only intermediate-sized spores and others held the entire range of spore sizes -- possibly with some producing sperm and others eggs."It's rare to get this many sporangia with well-preserved spores that you can measure," Leslie said. "We just kind of got lucky in how they were preserved."Fossil and modern heterosporous plants primarily live in wetland environments, such as floodplains and swamps, where fertilization of large spores is most effective. The ancient species, which will be formally described in a follow-up paper, has a medley of spores that is not like anything living today, Leslie said."The overarching story in land plant reproduction is one of increased division of labor and specialization and complexity, but that has to begin somewhere -- and it began with simply producing small spores and big spores," Leslie said. "With these kinds of fossils, we can identify some ways the plants were able to do that."Co-authors of the study are from Brown University, the University of North Carolina -- Chapel Hill and the University of Sheffield.Story Source:Materials provided by Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences.

A former Credit Suisse executive told bank officials and US authorities she believes she was spied on while in quarreling with the bank in July 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported.Colleen Graham, who used to co-head a joint venture between Credit Suisse and data-mining firm Palantir, said she believes a woman followed her for three days, according to The Journal. Graham said she thought the spying was in retaliation over her position on an accounting error at the business.The report comes four months after Credit Suisse hired detectives to follow former star banker Iqbal Khan, Bloomberg first reported September 22. The ex-Credit Suisse executive was followed before joining rival bank UBS, and entered a physical altercation with his pursuers after they tried to take his phone.Graham reached out to Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam, Chairman Urs Rohner, and board member John Tiner regarding her tailing after she heard of Khan's encounter, according to The Journal. She asked the executives to investigate her case and share it with regulatory authorities.The former executive first raised the alleged surveillance with the bank in a November 2017 whistleblower complaint. Graham alleged Credit Suisse and data-mining firm Palantir urged her to "distort the facts" of her business at the bank's joint venture to boost its 2016 revenue, according to The Journal.Graham said she was retaliated against for her refusal, with the two companies barring her from meetings, withholding her 2016 bonus, and making "thinly veiled threats" to fire her, The Journal reported. The former executive's complaint also detailed how she noticed a woman follow her for three days, even tailing her to a job interview. Graham alleged Credit Suisse and Palantir "interfered" with her chance at getting the job, The Journal reported.Credit Suisse "fully prevailed on this matter multiple times, in separate venues," corporate communications head Karina Byrne said in a statement. She added that the firm's "thorough and comprehensive" investigations found Graham's allegations "to be entirely baseless.""We will continue to vigorously defend this matter and refute all these allegations in any form," Byrne said.The US Labor Department's administrative court is expected to hear Graham's whistleblowing case in early 2020, according to The Journal.
UK chart data is now in for the week ending 2nd May, revealing that Animal Crossing: New Horizons has once again slipped down to second place.The game has been toing and froing with FIFA 20 over the last few weeks, with both titles fiercely contesting for first place on a regular basis. This week belongs to FIFA, but other Nintendo titles also managed to climb up a couple of places in the standings.As well as the Nintendo-published games in the top ten below, others such as Pokémon Sword and Shield, Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, Super Mario Maker 2, and Super Mario Party all saw slight position boosts a little further down the table.Here's a look at this week's top ten all formats chart: 
(CNN)History signals that the public's final verdict on President Donald Trump's possible impeachment won't be delivered until the 2020 election -- whatever happens next in the House and Senate, and however Americans react to it.The public reactions to impeachment proceedings against Presidents Richard Nixon in 1974 and Bill Clinton in 1998 fundamentally diverged, with most Americans ultimately supporting the former and a consistent majority opposing the latter.Yet the outcomes in the next presidential elections converged. In each case, the president's party lost the White House to a candidate -- Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Republican George W. Bush in 2000 -- who played off lingering public unease about the scandal that had precipitated the impeachment process against their predecessor. In each instance, impeachment functioned like a leak that corroded the foundation under the president's party in the next election.Those precedents suggest the revelations about Trump's conduct in the Ukraine investigation could complicate his path to a second term, whatever polls say now about the public response to his potential impeachment and removal from office. Recent polls indicate that while the controversy is not reducing the share of Americans who approve of Trump's job performance, it does appear to be hardening the opposition he faces among those who disapprove of him."The whole impeachment debate has intensified preexisting feelings about the President," says Republican pollster Whit Ayres. "Most people who like him do so with their eyes wide open. ... They understand his strengths and his weaknesses and they prefer him to the alternatives as they see it. On the other hand, people who dislike him will be even more appalled because what they are seeing reinforces their existing views."The risk for Trump in that dynamic is that a majority of 51 to 55% of Americans have consistently said they disapprove of his performance, while only around 40 to 45% have usually said they approve. Even if Americans remain closely split on whether Congress should impeach and remove Trump from office, the scandal may be solidifying a division of attitudes that forces him to find a path to reelection without support from anything close to a majority of the electorate."At the very least it is deepening a lot of Trump's problems," says Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. "I think it is confirming for voters that Trump is a person lacking in integrity and ethical standards in a way that is particularly concerning to college-educated men. And I don't think we are done with the impeachment story yet."Striking similarities in campaignsImpeachment provided a critical backdrop to both the 1976 and 2000 elections, which followed the proceedings against Nixon and Clinton. Nixon resigned in August 1974 after the House Judiciary Committee approved impeachment articles against him; the Senate failed to remove Clinton in February 1999, after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted on a near-party-line basis to impeach him in December 1998.The public reaction to these two confrontations utterly diverged. During the long gestation of the Watergate scandal, from early 1973 through Nixon's resignation, support for his impeachment slowly grew and his job approval rating steadily eroded. In Gallup polling, a majority of Americans supported Nixon's removal from office only in the final survey before his resignation; by then his approval rating had fallen to about 24%, though it remained around 50% among Republicans.By comparison, public opinion remained remarkably stable through 1998 during the House GOP's long march toward impeaching Clinton. Consistently in Gallup polling through that year, Americans opposed his impeachment and removal by about 2 to 1, and his approval rating remained well above 60%.Yet, despite these differences in the immediate public reaction, the presidential campaigns that followed these two impeachment proceedings unfolded with some striking parallels. In each case, the party that drove the impeachment inquiry won the next presidential election. And in each instance, that party did so behind a nominee who did not dwell on the scandal that had prompted impeachment -- but unmistakably presented himself as the antidote to it.Jimmy Carter, the Democratic former Georgia governor, did not stress Watergate during the 1976 campaign, insisting the American people had heard enough about it. But Watergate still infused everything about his campaign. Carter centered his candidacy not on a big, ambitious policy agenda but on an overriding promise to unify the nation and restore to America "a government as good as its people." That struck a powerful chord with voters exhausted by Watergate and allowed Carter, a one-term Georgia governor and former peanut farmer, to overcome doubts about his experience and narrowly defeat Gerald Ford, who had served as Nixon's vice president and then succeeded him as President after Nixon's resignation.In 2000, George W. Bush likewise did not dwell on the affair with a White House intern that triggered Clinton's impeachment. But it too infused Bush's campaign. Like Carter, Bush presented himself as a unifying figure, "a uniter, not a divider," in his phrase. And the Clinton scandal provided the backdrop for Bush's core promise in 2000: to "restore honor and dignity to the Oval Office." That messaging helped Bush squeeze out his narrow Electoral College victory over Al Gore, Clinton's vice president, even while narrowly losing the popular vote.As Tad Devine, one of Gore's top strategists, told me earlier this year, Bush skillfully found ways to tap the unease over Clinton's behavior without directly embracing the unpopular impeachment itself."It became a very valuable tool even though Bush didn't go around saying, 'Impeachment, impeachment,' " Devine told me. "He took the bad stuff from impeachment and put it front and center [in the campaign]. What could Gore say? 'I'll restore honor too'?"Trump's situation is differentPublic opinion over Trump's possible impeachment has followed a middle course between these two examples. Support for impeachment jumped to around 50% after Democrats formally announced their inquiry in September but has stagnated since then. Trump's job approval ratings have remained almost unchanged: In a new CNN survey conducted by SSRS and released this week, 50% of Americans supported Trump's impeachment and removal, a number unchanged since October. His job approval rating stood at just 42%, with 54% disapproving. Through all of this year, his approval rating in the CNN poll has varied only between 39% and 43%.In another important regard, Trump's situation differs decisively from these precedents: Unlike Nixon and Clinton, Trump himself will be on the ballot in 2020 if the House impeaches him and the Senate does not vote to remove him from office. Under that scenario, Trump would become the first impeached president to appear on the next general election ballot. (The only other president who faced this sanction was Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln's vice president, who was impeached but not removed by the Republican-led Congress in 1868; Johnson sought to run again that year as a Democrat but didn't win the nomination.)Trump's presence on the ballot might change the dynamic from the Nixon and Clinton precedents in some respects -- but likely won't alter them in others. The biggest difference is that unlike Ford or Gore -- who did not attempt to relitigate whether impeachment had been appropriate for the presidents they had served under -- Trump will likely try to mobilize more turnout from his core backers by insisting he was unfairly persecuted by an "unholy alliance" of Democrats, the media and the deep state, as he put it during a recent rally.Ayres, the Republican pollster, says Trump's unbending response to impeachment underlines the pugnacious take-no-prisoners posture that thrills his core supporters."Supporters take away he's a fighter, that he's never backs down, that he never gives in to the carping critics and that he will stand his ground no matter what the situation and hold his head high in the face of unrelenting criticism," he said.But Ayres, like a wide array of Democratic strategists, agrees the revelations in the Ukraine investigation are serving just as powerfully to reinforce the doubts Trump faces among those skeptical of him."It is another strike against him," says Josh Schwerin, senior strategist and communications director for Priorities USA, a leading Democratic Super PAC. "It reinforces the negative feelings they have about his actions and the way he carries himself."Trump as lesser of two evils?That dynamic is evident in recent poll results showing that overwhelming majorities of voters who disapprove of Trump's overall job performance view his actions in Ukraine as deeply troubling.In one recent Quinnipiac University national poll among voters who disapprove of Trump's job performance, 94% said he has abused the power of his office and 93% said he considers himself above the law, according to figures provided by the pollsters. Another Quinnipiac Poll found that 94% of those who disapprove of Trump's job performance say he was pursuing his own interests, and not the nation's, in Ukraine.In the new CNN survey, 90% of those who disapprove of Trump overall say that in his dealings with Ukraine he abused his presidential power to gain political advantage. Likewise, in the latest ABC/Washington Post survey, 88% of disapprovers said he did something wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, according to figures provided by the Post. Fully 89% of those who disapproved of Trump in the CNN survey considered his behavior so egregious that they endorsed the unprecedented step of removing him from office.Whether or not most Americans support removing Trump from office before his term, strategists in both parties generally agree that such judgments could complicate a critical part of the GOP plan for 2020. One of the Trump campaign's hopes is that it can convince some voters who now say they disapprove of him to vote for him nonetheless by making the Democratic nominee more unacceptable to them. To the extent the Ukraine investigation deepens the concerns of those disapproving voters, convincing them to accept Trump as the lesser of two evils obviously becomes more difficult. Schwerin says the key issue isn't whether voters who disapprove of Trump believe he should be removed now, but whether they can accept more of the behavior unearthed in the investigation for another four years.One of the most intriguing questions for 2020 is whether these dynamics will create any fissures among the different factions in the Republican coalition.In polling, all elements of the Republican coalition have unified against the Democratic-led impeachment (with the exception of the recent ABC/Washington Post poll that found that just over one-sixth of Republicans believe Trump should be removed.) But polling hints that after the threat of Trump's removal is gone --either because the House fails to impeach or the Senate refuses to convict --Republicans may differ more over the underlying behavior that the impeachment inquiry has revealed.The recent annual national American Values Survey by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute divided Republicans between the roughly 45% who said they receive their information mostly from Fox News Channel and the 55% who said they rely mostly on other sources. On impeachment these two Republican groups differed only modestly, with the idea generating opposition from 98% of the Fox watchers and 90% of the others.But on other relevant measures, the groups did split more. While 71% of the Fox watchers said they strongly approved of Trump's performance in office, only 39% of the non-Fox watchers agreed; roughly one-fifth of the latter group said they disapproved of him. One-third of those who relied on other sources said Trump has damaged the dignity of the presidency -- compared with just 1 in 11 of the Fox watchers). In the CNN survey, almost 1 in 6 Republicans and independents who lean toward the party said Trump abused his powers in Ukraine.Will weariness grow into opposition?Stanley B. Greenberg, the veteran Democratic pollster, sees openings for Democrats in those cracks. In a recent round of focus groups around the country, he said he found that some Republicans, even if they support Trump's policy goals, are growing exhausted by the relentless controversy and division surrounding him. The Ukraine scandal and impeachment fight, Greenberg believes, could crystallize those concerns. Greenberg says "probably the most important impact" of the ongoing impeachment struggle is that "it only reinforces that we'll have continued polarization and divisiveness" if Trump is reelected. "It doesn't create hope" for something different, Greenberg says.Given the underlying stability in public opinion about Trump, it appears unlikely that Democrats can amass a big majority to support his impeachment (absent perhaps some bombshell revelation from one of his inner circle who has so far refused to testify). And another few months with the impeachment debate dominating national news coverage -- first in the House and then possibly in the Senate -- will allow Republicans to raise charges of corruption in Ukraine against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, even though those allegations have been widely discredited by the media and in the House testimony from current and former Trump administration officials. Weeks more of impeachment debate in the House and an impeachment trial in the Senate could also help Trump energize his base of supporters for 2020.But more attention to Trump's behavior in Ukraine may also provide a stronger opportunity for the next Democratic nominee to reprise the core strategy of the winning candidates after the past two impeachments. Just as Carter in 1976 promised honesty and Bush in 2000 pledged decency, the next Democratic nominee may promise a return to normalcy after a Trump term defined by unending volatility, confrontation and collisions with legal boundaries.Biden previewed such arguments last weekend in Iowa; in a distant echo of Bush in 2000, he declared that one of the first responsibilities for the next president will be to "restore dignity to the White House."However much impeachment allows Trump to mobilize his base, the confrontation may strike many other voters as an uncomfortable preview of a second Trump term that extends -- and likely even enlarges -- the unstinting controversies of his first."There are a lot of negatives on Trump," says John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster advising Biden's campaign. "But at the end of the day I think people are so exhausted by him and they so want their lives back that that will be a really big psychological driving factor."
The coronavirus pandemic may last until 2022, according to a report published Thursday.A group of researchers at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak won't end until 60% to 70% of the human population is immune to the virus, which may take between 18 and 24 months.The experts laid out three scenarios for how the coronavirus pandemic will progress. The worst-case scenario among these three projections involves a second, larger wave of infections this fall and winter. The report authors suggest this is the most likely outcome, and states need to prepare for it."This thing's not going to stop until it infects 60 to 70% of people," Michael Osterholm, report author and the director of CIDRAP, told CNN. "The idea that this is going to be done soon defies microbiology." Osterholm and his colleagues examined multiple models that predict future coronavirus impacts, research about how well COVID-19 spreads between people, and data from past pandemics to reach their conclusions.The coronavirus outbreak shares important similarities to a pandemic influenza, like the 1918 Spanish flu (which infected 500 million people worldwide), which makes this type of flu a solid model for comparison. Both a pandemic influenza and the COVID-19 virus spread via droplets we emit when coughing or sneezing and can pass between infected people showing no symptoms — known as asymptomatic carriers. But even though pandemic influenza may be a good model to try and predict how the COVID-19 will outbreak will play out, experts still aren't sure what to expect.That's because the coronavirus spreads even more easily than the flu does. An average person with the coronavirus infects between 2 and 2.5 new people, this metric is known as the virus' R0 value. Seasonal influenza's Ro value is about 1.3. "There is no crystal ball to tell us what the future holds and what the 'end game' for controlling this pandemic will be," the report authors wrote.That's why Osterholm's group came up with three possible scenarios about what might be coming after this first wave of coronavirus infections ends.Scenario 1: The summer months and beyond bring a series of repetitive, smaller wavesIn this projection, the first COVID-19 wave is followed by a series of repetitive, smaller waves that occur through the summer and beyond. Those waves, which will come with a lower number of infections than the world is experiencing right now, will persist over a one- to two-year period. They'll gradually diminishing sometime in 2022.The authors noted that where those smaller waves occur could depend on what measures certain geographic areas have in place to "flatten the curve," including social distancing and non-essential business closures, and how those measures are rolled back. Scenario 2: A second, larger wave of infections hits this fall and winterThe worst of the three scenarios, and the most likely, is one in which the first wave is followed by a larger wave in the fall or winter of 2020, and one or more smaller subsequent waves in 2021.This mirrors what happened during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 flu.A second wave with more infections would require the US and other countries to reinstitute mitigation measures, like lockdowns, the authors wrote. "States, territories, and tribal health authorities should plan for the worst-case scenario," they added.Scenario 3: The world experiences a 'slow burn' of ongoing transmissionThe final scenario suggests that this first wave of coronavirus infections is the only wave. In the coming months, the COVID-19 pandemic would shift into a "slow burn" of ongoing transmission and new cases."While this third pattern was not seen with past influenza pandemics, it remains a possibility for COVID-19," the experts reported.This possibility would mean US states likely wouldn't need to lockdown again, although cases and deaths would continue to occur.Each of these projections could be influenced by the development of a vaccine. But any help a vaccine could provide during the pandemic will be a long time coming, the report authors said. The earliest a vaccine is expected is 2021. "And we don't know what kinds of challenges could arise during vaccine development that could delay the timeline," they added.

President Donald Trump tweeted a record 123 times on Thursday as the House Judiciary Committee held a marathon 14-hour debate on two articles of impeachment.Peter Baker of The New York Times pointed out in a tweet that Trump had tweeted or retweeted other posts 123 times as of 11:30 p.m. local time on Thursday, breaking his record for most tweets fired out in a single day. Trump posted several more tweets just after midnight on Friday morning, which included congratulating UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on his landslide election win.By Insider's count, Trump posted 95 tweets or retweets by noon on Thursday. On Wednesday, Trump similarly tweeted more than 60 times in three hours to criticize the impeachment inquiry and the FBI. Trump's Thursday Twitter spree broke his single-day posting record of 105, set last Sunday, according to Vox.As the House prepares to impeach Trump on charges of abusing his office and obstructing Congress, Trump has gone on a multiday retweet spree, flooding the internet with clips of Republican lawmakers and op-ed articles from conservative pundits defending him."I had very busy time and a very busy day, but my daughter said, 'You will be here,' so that was the end of that busy day, when a daughter says you have to be here," Trump said at the beginning of a White House summit on childcare and paid leave.The summit, which began at 11:15 a.m., was Trump's first event listed on his public schedule for Thursday. Later, Trump was scheduled to receive an intelligence briefing and attend this year's congressional ball with the first lady, Melania Trump. Trump was referring to his eldest daughter, Ivanka, an unpaid White House adviser who has three children with her husband, Jared Kushner. She has taken up a push for childcare and paid family leave as a major component of her policy portfolio.On Wednesday, the House passed a bipartisan defense-authorization package that secured one of Trump's top policy priorities by creating a Space Force and, for the first time, extended 12 weeks of paid parental leave to federal-government employees. 
The NCAA expects at least six Division I men's basketball programs will receive notices of allegations for Level I violations, the most serious infractions under NCAA rules, as a result of the federal government's investigation into corruption in the sport."The NCAA continues to investigate potential rules violations stemming from the Southern District of New York allegations and subsequent court proceedings. We are aggressively and thoroughly pursuing information and using all tools available to us through the NCAA infractions process," the NCAA said in a statement. "As a result, we expect that at least six Division I men's basketball programs will receive NCAA notice of allegations within the coming months, and likely additional schools thereafter. Colleges and universities have a responsibility to run their athletics programs within NCAA rules. Our membership expects us to hold accountable those who fail to do so."The schools that could receive notices of allegations were not identified.Stan Wilcox, the NCAA's vice president of regulatory affairs, told CBS Sports on Wednesday at an athletic directors conference in Orlando, Florida, that two programs might receive notices of allegations by early July and that four more probably will receive them by the end of the summer."There's even another group of cases that we're still working on," Wilcox said. "The main thing is that we're up and ready. We're moving forward, and you'll see consequences."Assistant coaches from four schools -- Arizona, Auburn, Oklahoma State and USC -- pleaded guilty to accepting bribes from aspiring business manager Christian Dawkins and others to influence their players to sign with his fledgling sports agency.During two federal criminal trials in the Southern District of New York, there was evidence presented or testimony from witnesses that coaches at a handful of other schools, including Creighton, Kansas, Louisville, NC State and Oregon, allegedly made offers of improper payments to players and their families or were providing them with payments.Officials at Arizona, Kansas, Louisville, NC State and USC have previously acknowledged that their men's basketball programs are under NCAA investigation.Louisville's Rick Pitino is the only head coach fired after the federal government indicted 10 men in October 2017, following a clandestine two-year investigation into bribes and other corruption. Wilcox said other head coaches might face penalties from the NCAA."Those top coaches that were mentioned in the trials where the information shows what was being said was a violation of NCAA rules, yes. They will be all part of these notices of allegations," Wilcox told CBS Sports.NCAA investigators have requested all documents that the schools submitted to the federal government in response to subpoenas and have conducted interviews on and off campus.Last month, during a meeting of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, Kevin Lennon, the NCAA's vice president for Division I governance, said the notices "will be coming.""You don't get in the way of a federal investigation," Lennon said. "Activity was going on during that span that was within our purview; but now that the court cases are done, now we're in a position where you're likely to see notices of allegations going to institutions that have violated NCAA rules, etc. I think you can anticipate notices of allegations will be coming."

These are firsts that will change the game – literally.”
The Bundesliga has been given the green light to resume in the coming weeks by chancellor Angela Merkel – with May 15 the earliest possible day for a restart. A leaked document on Wednesday said German football's return would be delayed with suggestions that the first fixtures could only be held after a two-week quarantine of all teams.  But initial demands for that extended spell have been removed from the document and the German government has now granted approval for a return of the league in the second half of May after a series of meetings, with Merkel commenting: 'We can safely state the first phase of the pandemic is behind us.'The government has told the Bundesliga, according to Bild, that they can pick a date in that timeframe for a return. The earliest option available would see the first action played on May 15. After the decision in Wednesday's meeting of German states and chancellor Merkel, the league now has to decide whether to start on May 15 or 22. All games will have to take place behind closed doors – or, as they are known in Germany, as 'ghost games'. Merkel commented: 'We have talked about sports and recreation and the Bundesliga, which will be able to resume operation soon.'A further meeting of the league and the clubs will now be held on Thursday to decide when the first match will take place. Chancellor Merkel held a meeting with the 16 heads of state on Wednesday morning at 10am to discuss Germany's plans for easing the lockdown – with some measures having been lifted on Monday. And one of the topics was the return of football – with approval given to a plan to allow a resumption from May 15.While the majority of states were keen on that date for a resumption, Rhineland-Palatinate and Bremen suggested it should take place later.There are concerns at Werder Bremen that their players will not be fit enough to restart as they have not been allowed to train due to restrictions in their state – and they believe they need 14 days of preparation.They are calling for the league to begin again later than the mooted May 15 date. The Bundesliga had initially hoped to resume on May 9, although that was pushed back. There were concerns that a series of incidents over the last few days could have caused issues. Salomon Kalou was suspended by Hertha Berlin after filming himself violating hygiene protocols – shaking hands with team-mates, for example.The first two rounds of tests held earlier this week revealed there had been 10 positive coronavirus cases.Meanwhile, Bundesliga 2 side Aue sent their whole team into isolation on Tuesday after a staff member tested positive.Health minister Jens Spahn said on Wednesday that there had to be strict punishment for violations of the coronavirus protocols: 'We have seen in the past few days that some players have to be more aware that something is at stake. 'That is why a clear crackdown of the German Football League and the individual teams is very, very important.'But he did hint at a resumption, adding: 'My impression is, of course, that many millions of fans in Germany also ask when it can start again'.There were 61 new deaths in Germany from coronavirus on Monday, as a strict testing regime has limited the spread of the virus.With the Bundesliga to be the first major league back if a May 15 resumption is confirmed – and the likes of the Premier League watching on – Bayern Munich star Manuel Neuer has urged the division's players to act responsibly.'I am speaking consciously of the football family and football matches, because the fact that advice will be given on the restart of the federal leagues and, if possible, a decision is likely to have consequences for all of football, right down to the many amateur clubs and the youngest generations - and beyond also for many other sports,' Neuer wrote for Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.'Even from other European countries, and indeed all over the world, people will be looking at us. This is an enormous responsibility for us, which we must be aware of with every fibre. We must be aware that it is also important to us now.' Elsewhere in Europe, LaLiga's players will start returning to training this week while the Premier League's 'Project Restart' will be discussed further on Monday.  
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth accelerated from a 17-month low in March, assuaging fears of an abrupt slowdown in economic activity, but a moderation in wage gains supported the Federal Reserve’s decision to suspend further interest rate increases this year.Milder weather boosted hiring in sectors like construction, but worsening worker shortages and lingering effects of tighter financial market conditions at the turn of the year left job growth below 2018’s brisk pace. The Labor Department’s closely watched employment report on Friday also showed a small upward revision to February’s meager job gains.“This was a Goldilocks report, with a rebound in job growth to calm fears of an imminent recession, and wage growth that was solid enough without triggering inflationary concerns,” said Curt Long, chief economist at the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions. “The Fed will be pleased, as it supports their present stance of holding firm on rates.”The U.S. central bank last month halted its three-year campaign to tighten monetary policy, dropping projections for any rate hikes this year after lifting borrowing costs four times in 2018. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 196,000 jobs in March. Data for February was revised modestly up to show 33,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 20,000. February job gains were the smallest since September 2017.The economy has shifted into lower gear as stimulus from the Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion tax cut package as well as increased government spending fades. A trade war between Washington and Beijing, and slowing global growth have also taken a toll on the economy, which in July will celebrate 10 years of expansion, the longest on record.President Donald Trump has boasted about the economy, especially the labor market, as being one of the big wins of his first term in office. Sluggish growth, if it persists, could pose a challenge to Trump’s re-election hopes next year.Trump, who has blamed the Fed’s relatively tighter monetary policy for the slowdown in economic activity, on Friday urged the central bank to cut interest rates.“I think they should drop rates,” Trump told reporters. “I think they really slowed us down.”Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 180,000 jobs last month. The pickup in job growth helped to boost U.S. stocks. The dollar rose marginally against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.The employment report added to fairly upbeat construction spending and factory data that led Wall Street banks to boost their growth estimates for the first quarter.Growth forecasts for the first quarter are between a 1.4 percent and 2.1 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter, stepping down from the July-September quarter’s brisk 3.4 percent pace.WAGE GAINS SLOWAverage hourly earnings increased by 0.1 percent in March after jumping 0.4 percent in February. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent in February, which was the biggest gain since April 2009.The length of the average workweek rose to 34.5 hours from 34.4 hours in February. As a result of the rebound in employment, modest wage gains and more hours worked, the aggregate weekly payrolls index, a proxy for take-home wages, increased 0.5 percent last month, which bodes well for consumer spending after it stalled in January.“The first quarter has been challenging, but the economy has better momentum entering the second quarter, said Roiana Reid, an economist at Berenberg Capital Markets in New York.The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.8 percent in March, close to the 3.7 percent that Fed officials project it will be by the end of the year. Though monthly job gains have moderated to an average of 180,000 this year from 223,000 in 2018, they remain above the roughly 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population.Economists expect job growth to average about 150,000 per month this year. There are about 7.58 million open jobs in the economy. Vacancies could remain elevated as 224,000 people dropped out of the labor force last month.The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 63.0 percent in March from 63.2 percent in February, which was the highest in more than five years.Employment at construction sites rebounded by 16,000 jobs in March after falling by 25,000 in February. Leisure and hospitality sector payrolls accelerated by 33,000 jobs last month, driven by a 27,300 increase at restaurants and bars.The manufacturing sector lost 6,000 jobs in March, the first decline in factory payrolls since July 2017. Factory payrolls rose 1,000 in February. Employment at motor vehicle assembly plants fell by 6,300 jobs last month.Auto manufacturers have announced thousands of job cuts to deal with slowing sales that have led to an inventory bloat.Professional and business services employment increased by 37,000 jobs last month. The government added 14,000 jobs in March. There were increases in healthcare, transportation and warehousing employment, as well as financial activities, utilities and information industries.But retail payrolls fell for a second straight month in March. Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, declined for the second time in three months.
Growing up on the Upper West Side with a Haitian mother and a Cantonese father helped shape the designer Phillip Wong into something of a professional polyglot. Along with designing for the streetwear brand Hood By Air and making merch for musicians like Blood Orange and Porches, he co-founded the cologne company Hawthorne with his childhood friend Brian Jeong. Wong’s knack for knowing what he wants, when he wants it, also informs the way he eats: “It’s just kind of like, ‘It’s time for this,’ and nothing else exists,” he says. This week he was going through an egg phase, which he satisfied at Waverly Restaurant. He also made soba and went out for bialys, and tried to find Salt Bae at his New York restaurant — only to find out the living meme was out of town. Read all about it in this week’s Grub Street Diet.Friday, March 29I had a meeting in the morning and I always get super hungry in conference rooms. There’s something about them that reminds me of sitting in first-period class in high school and always thinking about lunch, so I had to make sure I ate breakfast. Before getting out of bed I ordered an egg and avocado sandwich on a toasted English muffin (with an extra egg and bacon) from Waverly Restaurant, which is just a no-nonsense neighborhood spot. I go in and out of heavy egg phases — it’s either every morning or no mornings at all.The meeting was only a short walk away, on Lafayette, right above Supreme, except that location was undergoing renovations, so the usual throng of crazed non-skater customers was absent, which was amazing.On my walk down to my office, I stopped by my usual lunchtime emporium, Canal Street Market. There are just enough options for you to feel like you’ll try something new each time you walk in, but also only enough options that you usually go back to what feels right.What felt right — and always feels right — was my favorite spot Izakaya/ Samurice. Quick Japanese comfort food that’s always pretty on-point. I like their selection of meal add-ons as well (like ikura, a.k.a. salmon roe, uni, and natto). I got the salmon bento box topped with ikura, which is what I usually get. It came with brown rice, seaweed, pickled pink ginger strips, cabbage with that “secret” sesame dressing, broccoli, and spicy greens. It’s super filling and the owner is a cool guy. I also got the miso soup (with a bonito drip and scallions) because the meal never feels complete unless there are multiple steps to it.I’m definitely attracted to strong flavors. I think it’s kind of just growing up where I did, and also my parents being immigrants — infusing their cuisines into the Upper West Side mix. We’d have bagels and lox; my mom’s Haitian family had their amazing red rice and beans that I always craved; and my dad — he’s from Hong Kong — would always make these awesome Cantonese dishes. I kind of just grew accustomed to craving all these ridiculous flavors and wanting them all together at once.Anyway, before I left Canal Street Market I stopped at Boba Guys to get a very non-boba drink: an iced matcha latte with Oatly oat milk, no toppings, and no sweetness. Since I got coffee out of my life (La Colombe, I miss you) about a year ago (I was up to four to five cold brews a day, and NOT sleeping, ever), I’ve tried a bunch of alternatives and landed on matcha. It doesn’t fulfill the energy needs, but it serves the same ritual function. And good matcha is really good.A busy day at the office carried into the evening, and I was not going to have time to eat if I wanted to make the evening celebrations. It was my friend Sal’s pop-up party at the ongoing On Canal installation series, and after that, my friend Jenny’s birthday at the Soho Grand. On my way home I picked up some sake at the spot Soho Wines & Spirits on West Broadway. They’re kind of the perfect neighborhood store, a good range of options with affordable prices, although I wish they’d have some more obscure offerings. (Susucaru! Orange wine!!) I got some dry sake to bring to Sal’s pop-up and headed home to scrape together something to eat.I only really had supplies for some soba, so I went with it. I changed and then cooked soba noodles, set them under some cold water, and then fried some ginger with sesame seeds to toast, added extra-firm tofu, and then some dashi and soy sauce after the tofu was extra crispy. I put it all together with the soba, then topped it off with some shiso, sliced scallions, oshinko, and wasabi. This dinner was a mix of leftover stuff I had gotten earlier in the week from two Japanese markets I usually go to, Dainobu and Sunrise Mart. Japanese markets are one of the great pleasures of the world, my all-time favorite being the Mitsuwa in Jersey. I think what draws me to the markets is that there are so many micro-universes in them. There’s a bunch of storytelling, in a way. Japanese markets give you this insane universe of little gems.Anyway, this only took about 15 minutes, and then I was out the door. I made it to Canal Street with my sake in time to see Sal DJ and dance a bit before heading to Jenny’s birthday. The event ended at 10 p.m. sharp, so my friends and I walked over to neighborhood-favorite bar Toad Hall. We had a couple more drinks while some splintered off. Then a handful of us headed to the birthday at Soho Grand to have a fun night.Saturday, March 30After sleeping in a little, I had a workout and then picked up breakfast from Tacombi on Bleecker Street. It was really that I was craving rice and beans and hot sauce, and Tacombi was the first thing I thought of. Plus, I hadn’t eaten from there in a while, so it was nice to switch things up. I ordered two breakfast tacos, which were filled with eggs and carnitas and really more like mini burritos, and a side of rice and beans.After breakfast I had a bunch of errands to catch up on, but I needed my afternoon matcha, so I stopped by Cha Cha Matcha on Lafayette. I wanted the usual iced matcha latte, but Cha Cha had been out of oat milk for weeks (OATLY, what’s good!) so I went with macadamia milk, which was also refreshing but slightly too sweet.A few hours later my girlfriend Violet came over so we could head to Perry St for a date. Her friend Hunter is also the new GM there and she hadn’t visited him yet. We got there a little early, so Hunter started us with some Champagne before we sat at the bar to wait for our reservation. At the bar, I ordered a Cara cara julep (partly trying to manifest some spring weather) and it wasn’t long before we were seated. The menu all sounded really delicious and Hunter was keen on sending dishes out as well, but I really couldn’t stop myself. I ordered the crispy snapper sashimi, calamari with yuzu foam, soft-shell crab, scallops, and sturgeon caviar. Hunter additionally sent out some sweet pea soup, white asparagus with lemon fondue, and a very chill dessert spread to finish. This included some amaro (I love Fernet, and so do all my friends, so this was perfect), and chocolate pudding with candied violets. These are my new favorite thing — this dinner could’ve used little side dishes of capers, caviar, and candied violets.The dinner was so rich and loving that I don’t remember much from after paying the bill. But I wanted more. We passed out the second we got back home.Sunday, March 31I had another big dinner coming up, so I wanted to keep breakfast light. After laundry, I ordered from this spot Village Natural, which I order from most weekends. I think it’s part routine, part not wanting to stress about anything on the weekend. It’s always on time, the delivery guy is always super funny when he pops in. It’s always a good experience, and good energy. So why fight that? Also, it’s super clean food and they break down most breakfast things into “sides,” so you don’t really have to stress if you have a specific craving for one thing that’s not included in a specific plate. I got four eggs, soy bacon, and a roasted veggie cutlet.Violet’s cousin was in town from the U.K. with her boyfriend, and he really wanted to go to Nusr-Et, a.k.a. the Salt Bae restaurant in midtown. It’s definitely not something I ever thought I’d do, but I was really excited to see the empire that this meme had birthed.As soon as we walked in, we were assaulted with merchandise, clouds of dry ice, whirling napkins, and a restaurant-wide song-and-dance that I’m pretty sure never stopped. We were then taken to our table in the back room. On the way back, we passed this never-ending glass display case housing piles of mustard rubbed T-bone steaks, gold leaf–encased tomahawks, and an entire hall of lamb racks. It was quite far from where I started the day.We sat down in the much quieter back room and ordered our guests’ recommendations. We got the meat sushi (which was just avocado cream wrapped in steak), the steak tartare (mostly because it had capers — my favorite), sizzling steak in butter, the lamb rack, and fries. The food was actually not bad, but I was disappointed Salt Bae wasn’t actually there — he wasn’t even in the country, actually. We looked up his whereabouts on Instagram and it looked like he was going to be in Turkey for a while. That hit really hard. You would assume at least the rest of the staff would be Salt Bae-ing your food! But no.Monday, April 1I worked from home for a minute before heading in to the office. It’s sometimes hard to settle your energy when you compete with the Monday-morning rush. On my way in, I stopped by Smile to Go. Their lunch plates are always really filling and a little more nuanced than what you would get at a Dig Inn. I got a plate with mustard vinaigrette salad with marinated potatoes, plum, and kale, green beans, quinoa with peas and mint, a side of grilled chicken, and their sweet pea soup. I always get a side of some sort, wherever I go. Here it’s usually the banana buckwheat bread, but it was unnecessarily windy outside, so I felt like a soup. It was dairy-free, too. I needed to get away from that after the weekend.Afterward, I stopped by Boba Guys for my matcha.I stayed in the office pretty late and then went home to keep working, so I ordered from one of my weeknight usuals, Som Bo. It’s one of many places I’ve only Seamlessed from and I can’t say for sure that it’s even a physical establishment. Another one is this spot Trattoria Pesce Pasta that my friend Hudson and I would separately order from every Sunday. We became tight with the delivery guy, who would always show up in all white. Pants, shoes, cloth du-rag, apron, and T-shirt — everything. Simple red-sauce place, but always satisfying. Anyway, Som Bo offers up a really easygoing menu, so I didn’t browse for 20 minutes indecisively. I ordered the steak plate with charred broccoli, sweet potatoes, and grilled tofu. Yes, I was really hungry. I sometimes order two dinners simultaneously.Tuesday, April 2After a morning meeting in Brooklyn, I had to stop by my friend Nate’s new spot Gertie. I had gone for their soft launch but hadn’t been back yet. It’s really good, especially when you’re in an egg phase. Also if you aren’t. This place is a must.I ordered the egg on bialy with peppers, bacon, and mushrooms. I never ate bialys growing up. There wasn’t a standout spot near me, and Absolute was just the place. Every weekend my dad would leave the house, maybe at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m., and wait in line at Absolute with the rest of the neighborhood people. I don’t eat bagels on a regular basis anymore, though, and Gertie’s turned me back on to bialys. They almost taste like an artisanal bread as opposed to this carb cloud.Another busy day at the studio made me crave something spicy. I ordered from Spicy Moon, a fun Sichuan-style vegan spot. I ordered the mapo tofu and the boiled watercress with soy-ginger sauce. The sauce is reminiscent of eating a whole steamed fish at a Cantonese-style restaurant. Very comforting and flavorful.Growing up, I wouldn’t just crave food, I would crave the repetition of a meal. Whether it was eating an everything bagel from Absolute every weekend morning (heavily toasted, like a seven out of ten on the crisp scale, with some kind of fish spread and capers), my mom’s family’s Haitian rice, my dad’s Cantonese-style steamed ginger beef, La Rosita’s breakfast with rice and beans, eggs, ham, and Cuban toast, or a slice of Sal & Carmine’s after school. That’s how I became something of a creature of habit — keep it simple and go with your cravings.
LONDON (Reuters) - Voters went to the polls on Thursday in an election that will pave the way for Brexit under Prime Minister Boris Johnson or propel Britain towards another referendum that could ultimately reverse the decision to leave the European Union.After failing to deliver Brexit by an Oct. 31 deadline, Johnson called the election to break what he cast as political paralysis that had thwarted Britain’s departure and sapped confidence in the economy.The face of the “Leave” campaign in the 2016 referendum, 55-year-old Johnson fought the election under the slogan of “Get Brexit Done”, promising to end the deadlock and spend more on health, education and the police.His main opponent, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, 70, promised higher public spending, nationalisation of key services, taxes on the wealthy and another referendum on Brexit.All major opinion polls suggest Johnson will win, though pollsters got the 2016 referendum wrong and their models predict outcomes ranging from a hung parliament to the biggest Conservative landslide since the era of Margaret Thatcher.Seven eve-of-election opinion polls published on Wednesday showed the Conservatives ahead of Labour by an average of nearly 10 points although Labour narrowed the gap in four of them.“We could have a Conservative majority government which will get Brexit done and unleash Britain’s potential,” Johnson told campaigners. “This election is our chance to end the gridlock but the result is on a knife-edge.”Corbyn said the Conservatives were the party of “billionaires” while Labour represented the many.“You can vote for despair and vote for the dishonesty of this government, or you can vote Labour and get a government that can bring hope to the future,” he said.Polls opened at 0700 GMT and will close at 2200 GMT when an exit poll will give the first indications of the result. Official results from the bulk of the United Kingdom’s 650 constituencies begin to come in from 2300 GMT to 0500 GMT.While Brexit framed the United Kingdom’s first December election since 1923, the tortuous exit from the EU has variously fatigued, enthused and enraged voters while eroding loyalties to the two major parties.BREXIT AND BORISA majority would allow Johnson to lead the country out of the club it joined in 1973, but Brexit would be far from over. He must negotiate a trade agreement with the EU in a self-imposed deadline of 11 months.After Jan. 31, Britain would enter a transition period during which it would negotiate a new relationship with the 27 EU members. He has pledged to do that by the end of 2020.Sterling markets are pricing in a Johnson win and the pound was up against the dollar and the euro in early trading on Thursday.But two historic referendums - on Scottish independence in 2014 and Brexit in 2016 - and two national elections in 2015 and 2017 have delivered often unexpected results that ushered in political crises.The election pitches two of the most unconventional British politicians of recent years against each other. Both have been repeatedly written off by opponents and both offer starkly different visions for the world’s fifth-largest economy.Johnson’s pitch is Brexit but he shrank from anything more radical in a heavily choreographed campaign. Corbyn pitched what he calls a radical transformation for a country long wedded to free-market liberalism.Johnson, the New York-born former mayor of London, won the top job in July. His predecessor, Theresa May, resigned after failing to get parliamentary backing for her Brexit deal with the EU and then losing her party’s majority in a snap election.Johnson defied critics by striking a new deal with the EU but was unable to navigate the maze of a divided British parliament and was defeated by opponents whom he portrayed as subverting the will of the people.The United Kingdom voted 52%-48% in 2016 to quit the EU. But parliament has been deadlocked since May’s failed bet on a 2017 snap election over how, when and even whether to leave.Corbyn, once an opponent of the EU, says he would remain neutral if he was a prime minister overseeing another referendum. He pledged to overthrow a “rigged system” he said was run by billionaires and tax dodgers.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the scientific face of America's pandemic response, dismissed the theory that coronavirus originated in a lab in Wuhan, contradicting the president and his Secretary of State in an escalating confrontation with China."The best evidence shows the virus behind the pandemic was not made in a lab in China," Dr. Anthony Fauci said in an exclusive interview with National Geographic published on Monday. "Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that [this virus] evolved in nature and then jumped species."He added that he doesn't believe the alternate theory that someone discovered coronavirus in the wild, brought it to a lab and then it accidentally unleashed it on the public.Fauci's statement contradicts an April 30 comment by President Donald Trump that he had seen convincing evidence that the coronavirus originated from China's Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he'd seen "enormous evidence" supporting the theory, but didn't elaborate.The New York Times also reported last week the administration is pressuring some within the intelligence community to lend weight to the WIV theory. There is not yet any publicly available evidence supporting the WIV's involvement in the pandemic.U.S. intelligence has concluded that the COVID-19 novel coronavirus was neither man-made nor genetically modified, though officials are investigating whether it could have been released from the WIV.China has roundly rejected any accusation that it mishandled the outbreak or that the WIV was involved in the pandemic. On Monday, The Global Times newspaper—owned by the official publication of the Chinese Communist Party—published an editorial demanding that Pompeo provide any evidence for his claim, suggesting he was "bluffing."The Chinese government has often rejected criticisms that it mishandled the epidemic, stating that international critics are merely spreading propaganda to distract from their own countries' mistakes during the pandemic.Trump and Pompeo's claim about the WIV lab has escalated tensions between the U.S. and China. Officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have accused China of concealing the severity of the epidemic early on to hoard medical supplies.The DHS report also claimed that Chinese leaders deliberately didn't notify the World Health Organization (WHO) of the virus' contagion status through most of January to downplay its severity.The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the U.S told Newsweek that it considered the report just another "groundless accusation."Regardless, a May 1 poll from The Economist and YouGov found that almost twice as many Republicans as Democrats now see China as an "enemy" of the state since the U.S. coronavirus outbreak began. The poll also revealed that nearly half of all Americans believe that the virus was "definitely" or "probably" created in a lab. While 29 percent of Democrats believed the statement, more than two-thirds of Republicans did.The public feud over the lab has coincided with the escalation of military tensions. Last Tuesday, the U.S. Navy sailed a second ship through the South China Seas, challenging China's claim to the disputed waters. China's armed forces, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), said that it had expelled the first U.S. Naval ship, the USS Barry.The Chinese military's social media accused the U.S. of violating "international law and China's sovereignty and security interests" through "provocative acts," calling the sailing of ships "incompatible with the current joint efforts of the international community to fight against the Covid-19," according to the South China Morning Post."These provocative acts by the U.S. side ... seriously violated China's sovereignty and security interests, deliberately increased regional security risks and could easily trigger an unexpected incident."However, a Navy spokesperson denied that the PLA forced the USS Barry out of the disputed waters, telling Newsweek last Wednesday that "all interactions that occurred were in accordance with maritime norms."Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and a prominent member of President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force, joins task force response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx in their doubt of Trump and Pompeo's claim.In a Sunday appearance on CBS News' Face the Nation, Dr. Birx said the evidence is lacking to prove that the coronavirus epidemic began from an accident in the Wuhan laboratory.On April 28, Newsweek reported that NIAID funded scientists at the WIV and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses. The WIV's work on bat coronaviruses explains the Trump administration's focus on the lab as a possible culprit for the epidemic.In 2019, the NIAID provided backing for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to commit $3.7 million over six years to the WIV for research including some studies into gain-of-function. This money came after another $3.7 million, 5-year project for studying various bat coronaviruses. That project concluded in 2019. The NIH canceled the latest $3.7 million project on Friday, April 24, Politico reported.Richard Ebright, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers University, noted that the project description would've involved enhancing bat coronavirus to infect human cells and lab animals using genetic engineering techniques.Ebright and other scientists have opposed gain-of-function research because it risks the possibility of accidentally releasing the virus from a lab and creating a pandemic."Determining the molecular Achilles' heel of these viruses can allow scientists to identify novel antiviral drug targets that could be used to prevent infection in those at risk or to better treat those who become infected... [creating] a critical foundation for generating appropriate countermeasures and, ultimately, protecting the public health," Dr. Fauci and two co-authors wrote in a December 30, 2011 Washington Post article defending their work. 
Hall of Fame coach Don Shula died on Tuesday at the age of 90. One of his Hall of Fame pupils took the loss harder than he thought he would.“I was out cutting brush in a field, and my wife Audrey called me and said Coach had passed,” former Dolphins running back Larry Csonka told reporters on Tuesday. “I never really knew until that moment how close that rascal had really got to me, until he was gone. Unfortunately through the course of my life, losing parents and different loved ones, you realize after they’re gone how much more they meant to you than what you realized when they were here. I hope I can be better at that in the future because I felt a terrible loss. I felt like someone very close to me and my family had passed.”Csonka was struck by Shula’s mindset, even if Csonka wasn’t truly a fan of the approach until it produced a perfection season in 1972.“Coach Shula was such a rock,” Shula said. “He was . . . so exact in his feelings, so totally 100 percent, ‘This is the way it is.’ You drew off that strength when you were around him without even realizing it. Sometimes I resented him for it. More often than not, I resented him for it. I muttered with the rest of the players. ‘This is too much, too long, too hot, too everything,’ but the result was perfection. One time. One time in the course of 100 years, one team made every play it had to make during the course of a season to attain perfection. One time. And we were lucky enough to be with that. Now that doesn’t reflect the entirety of his career obviously, but it is a little microcosm of what he was about — that kind of dedication — and once we learned that in ’72, then I never questioned him again.”Csonka wondered aloud where Shula and other former football people go when they pass. Csonka has an idea, one that is bad news for the players and coaches who were already there.“I don’t know where old NFL players go,” Csonka said. “I don’t know – Lombardi, coaches, great players, all the great ones – where are they? Where do they go after they die? Well, I’d like to believe they go to heaven. But I’ll tell you, if they ship the football players off and the coaches off to a certain place, wherever that place is, tonight there is going to be one hell of a lightning bolt hit it because Shula is going to arrive and things are going to change.”Csonka and a teammate once sparked a different kind of lightning bolt with a prank they pulled on their coach.“Manny Fernandez and I decided to go fishing the day after a game — an exhibition game,” Csonka said. “We went out and Manny Fernandez, while we were fishing — Manny was a defensive tackle for us — and he said, ‘Csonk, there’s a gator over on the shore with babies,’ and I said, ‘Yeah, I don’t want any part of it.’ And he said, ‘You know, I can catch one of those,’ and I said, ‘Manny, I don’t think you can catch a baby alligator. You’re going to lose fingers or a leg or the mama’s going to get you. That’s going to be a bad situation.’ He said, ‘No, I’m telling you. I could do it.’“And with that, Manny jumped over out of the boat, went up on the bank, went into the bushes — it was like something in a movie. There was tumbling and screaming and growling and pretty soon Manny Fernandez came walking out of the bushes with a baby alligator about, I don’t know, two-and-a-half, three feet long. [Manny] walked over, threw it in the boat and I jumped out of the boat.“To make a long story short, we took it back to camp. We were going to put it in the pond out front. On the way back to camp, we got the idea that we thought it’d be pretty funny to put it in Shula’s shower. He had a separate shower than the team, devoted to coaches, of course. We thought that would be kind of humorous so we took a vote and [putting it in the shower] won by one vote [and] that we would tape the gator’s mouth shut just in case it got ahold of him in the shower. We didn’t want to lose him entirely. So we taped its nose shut and put it in the shower, and he came out and saw it and came into the locker room and was raising cain and headed straight for me, but I saw him coming so I jumped out the side door and Jim Kiick took the brunt of the abuse for the alligator in the shower.“But the good thing about Shula — the great thing about Shula — was his intensity with anything connected with football, but on a thing like the alligator, he had a great sense of humor, he appreciated that and he had a good laugh about it.”Shula led the Dolphins to a pair of Super Bowl wins, and three straight Super Bowl appearances. The run began in only Shula’s third season with the team, and in only the second after the AFL merged with the NFL.
The unraveling of J.Crew has spun many Twitter threads, from fans mourning the possible end of an iconic American brand to those dancing on the preppy label’s grave.J.Crew Group Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, saddled with $1.65 billion in debt (which is being converted into equity) and claiming that store closures during the COVID-19 pandemic will cost it $900 million in sales.The news led J.Crew to top Google GOOG, +0.46% searches and to go viral on Twitter TWTR, +4.26% as one of the first major retail casualties of the coronavirus outbreak that has essentially shut down the U.S. economy.And, as should be expected, many Twitter users had snarky reactions to the news, including posts mocking the brand’s signature preppy aesthetic, or tweets arguing that the countless small, family-owned businesses which are hanging on by a thread right now should be considered the bigger tragedy.Still others posted memes about gleefully waiting for potential J.Crew going-out-of-business sales, saying they couldn’t afford the retailer’s clothes otherwise. Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us held liquidation sales when their stores closed in 2018, after all. And retail analysts told MarketWatch that J. Crew “may have to get extremely aggressive,” which could include markdowns to help move inventory that’s been sitting on shelves since the coronavirus shutdowns began, in order to elevate cash.But many of the Twitter responses, while humorous and savage, actually have a point.Several noted that J.Crew’s financial troubles were terminal long before the pandemic struck.The company barely avoided bankruptcy in 2017 when creative director Jenna Lyons and CEO Mickey Drexler stepped down, even as sales plummeted and debt mounted. J.Crew missed the “athleisure” trend entirely.From the MarketWatch archives (June 2017): J.Crew has a new CEO, but that won’t fix its debt problemIn fact, as Eric Snyder, a partner at Wilk Auslander and chairman of the firm’s bankruptcy department, told MarketWatch on Monday: “Even if there were no pandemic, it wouldn’t have changed anything.”Read more:J.Crew was in trouble even before COVID-19 due to a big debt burden and failure to keep up with trendsOthers called out the high prices of many J.Crew pieces at a time when Americans are strapped for cash and turning to more affordable items from fast-fashion retailers like the Inditex-owned ITX, +1.48% Zara and H&M Hennes and Mauritz HNNMY, +3.23%, budget-friendly big-box stores like Walmart WMT, -0.37% and Target TGT, -2.01%, and online stores such as Amazon AMZN, -0.61%.But it’s also not surprising that the retailer’s struggle has inspired so much chatter.J.Crew has been woven in pop culture since it rolled out its mail-order-catalog collection of chinos, pocket tees and sweaters in the mid-1980s before becoming a staple of upscale shopping malls. And many shoppers bought into its mixing of formal and informal pieces. First lady Michelle Obama, who became a fashion icon during her husband’s presidential campaign and presidency, frequently dressed herself and her daughters in the brand. “Ladies, we know J.Crew. You can get some good stuff online!” she said while wearing a silk blouse, gold skirt and cardigan on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” in October 2008, for example.And former J.Crew creative director Lyons became a style icon in her own right with her signature chunky black glasses, and even made a cameo on HBO’s T, +3.14% hit series “Girls” in 2014.So, many J.Crew fans mourned the downfall of their beloved brand on social media, as well.  
New Zealand's military forces began a high-risk operation on volcanic White Island on Friday to recover bodies of eight people killed in an eruption this week, despite warnings that the island was still highly volatile.Authorities have faced growing pressure from families of victims and the wider local community to recover the bodies as soon as possible. NZ police had previously refused to go in due to safety risks.New Zealand defence force personnel are being deployed in the mission on Friday, along with assistance from the police and other agencies in the recovery mission that could take a few hours, police said.The mission was to be launched from a navy ship off the island.The teams will wear protective gear, but the police gave no further details.Six bodies could be seen and there would be "very limited" opportunity to search for the other two, Deputy Commissioner Mike Clement said on Thursday.Dangerous conditionsSteam and mud are still jetting from the active vents on Whakaari, where seismic activity on the New Zealand island is reported "a factor of 12" times stronger than before Monday's deadly eruption.Volcanic Geologist Graham Leonard from the New Zealand geophysical agency GNS said the possibility of another eruption was increasing.“Whakaari-White Island volcano remains highly volatile and uncertain. Our experts estimate the likelihood of an eruption has moved to 50 to 60 per cent in the next 24 hours, up from 40 to 60 per cent yesterday,” he said.
The head of a global partnership to end tuberculosis (TB) said she is “sickened” by research that revealed millions more people are expected to contract the disease as a result of Covid-19 restrictions.Up to 6.3 million more people are predicted to develop TB between now and 2025 and 1.4 million more people are expected to die as cases go undiagnosed and untreated during lockdown. This will set back global efforts to end TB by five to eight years.“The fact that we’ve rolled back to 2013 figures and we have so many people dying, this for me is sickening,” said Lucica Ditiu, executive director of the Stop TB Partnership. “I am outraged that just by not being able to control what we do … and forgetting about programmes that exist we lose so much, starting with the loss of the lives of people.”There is currently no TB vaccine for adults, only one for children. We look in amazement on a disease that … is 120 days old and it has 100 vaccine candidates in the pipelineLucica Ditiu, Stop TB Partnership“I have to say we look from the TB community in a sort of puzzled way because TB has been around for thousands of years,” Ditiu said. “For 100 years we have had a vaccine and we have two or three potential vaccines in the pipeline. We need around half a billion [people] to get the vaccine by 2027 and we look in amazement on a disease that … is 120 days old and it has 100 vaccine candidates in the pipeline. So I think this world, sorry for my French, is really fucked up,” she said.“The fear we have in the community is that researchers are heading towards just developing a vaccine for Covid. That’s on the agenda of everyone now and very few remain focused on the others [diseases]. We don’t have a vaccine for TB, we don’t have a vaccine for HIV, we don’t have a vaccine for malaria and out of all this, TB is the oldest. So why this reaction? I think because we are a world of idiots. What can I say?” The figures, published on Wednesday, are based on a three-month lockdown and a 10-month period of restoring services after lockdown is lifted.The research was commissioned by the Stop TB Partnership in collaboration with Imperial College London, Avenir Health and Johns Hopkins University. It was modelled on data drawn from rapid assessments of the impact of the coronavirus on TB services in countries with some of the highest number of cases.TB kills 1.5 million people a year, more than any other infectious disease.The past few years have seen a steady decline in cases as a result of more services to treat the disease and prevent its spread.Five years ago, world leaders pledged to end the TB epidemic by 2030. At a high-level meeting in 2018, they promised to scale up their response, including doubling funding by 2022. 
Former Vice President Joe Biden on Friday joked about the inappropriate touching accusations made against him by a number of women just days after pledging that he would be “more mindful and respectful” of people’s space.The longtime politician’s two jokes during a speech at a conference in Washington could shed some early light on how the likely 2020 Democratic presidential candidate plans to rebuff accusations that he made inappropriate physical contact.One joke came shortly after Biden invited four children on stage. Biden put his arm around a young boy and told the crowd, “by the way, he gave me permission to touch him.”The comment provoked laughter from the kids onstage, as well as those in the audience. He was speaking at a conference of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.It was the second joke Biden made about the accusations during the speech. Earlier, Biden joked that Lonnie Stephenson, IBEW’s international president, gave Biden permission to hug him.The jokes earned pushback from at least one of the women who have accused Biden in recent weeks of inappropriate physical contact.They show that Biden “hasn’t reflected at all on how his inappropriate and unsolicited touching made women feel uncomfortable,” said Lucy Flores, who in an article in The Cut published last month accused Biden of kissing her on the back of her head during a rally in 2014, while she was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor of Nevada.“To make light of something as serious as consent degrades the conversation women everywhere are courageously trying to have,” Flores said.Flores is one of several women who have come out with complaints about Biden’s behavior, which they said made them uncomfortable. The accusations have threatened to upend Biden’s potential shot at the Democratic nomination.After the speech, Biden told reporters he was sorry that “I didn’t understand,” but that he was “not sorry for any of my intentions.”“I am not sorry for anything I have ever done. I have not been disrespectful to any man or woman,” Biden said.On Wednesday, Biden posted a video on Twitter in which he sought to head off the political impact of the allegations.“Social norms have begun to change, they’ve shifted, and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset,” Biden said in the video. “And I get it. I get it. I hear what they’re saying, I understand.”President Donald Trump, who has been caught on tape bragging about sexual assault, on Thursday responded by posting to Twitter a meme that mocked Biden’s pledge.
Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, one of its biggest events of the year, is shifting online and will be held on June 22, amid concerns about the novel coronavirus and social distancing measures that continue to be extended throughout Silicon Valley. Apple also said that WWDC will be free for all developers to access via its developer app and website.Apple earlier announced that the event, which typically takes place in early June and reveals new software for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, would transition to being online-only as its native San Francisco Bay Area began instituting lockdowns. CNET's global team will cover WWDC, as well as other conferences that have shifted online, just as we always do -- by providing real-time updates, commentary and analysis you can only get here.Apple is just the latest in a string of companies shifting or canceling events as the coronavirus has spread around the world. The virus, for which there is no approved vaccine or cure, has killed more than 250,000 people worldwide, and infected more than 3.6 million people. Other companies like the internet giants Facebook and Google have also canceled their respective developer events, which were planned for the spring. Large organizations too have scuttled their plans, including the annual SXSW music and tech festival in Texas and the E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. Even Disneyland shut down.Though Apple typically focuses on new software at its WWDC event each year, including updates to its iOS and MacOS operating systems, it does sometimes introduce devices as well. Last year, it unveiled its new $5,999 Mac Pro desktop and $4,999 Apple Pro Display XDR, aimed at professional artists, editors and coders.Apple typically sponsors over 300 students from around the world to come to California for WWDC, based on a coding contest. This year, it's doing a Swift Student Challenge instead, and the winning students will get WWDC swag.Apple's been holding WWDC at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center since 2017, which it moved to after outgrowing the space at San Francisco's Moscone West. When the company announced plans to move WWDC online-only in March, it committed $1 million to local San Jose organizations to offset revenue lost from moving to the online-only format this year.  
Call of Duty's free-to-play battle royale game, Warzone, is performing incredibly well right now, and Activision is apparently going to continue to support the game even after the next mainline Call of Duty game comes out later this year. In a new interview, Infinity Ward's Taylor Kurosaki teased that Warzone will be the "throughline that connects all the various sub-franchises of Call of Duty."Reading between the lines here, it sounds like Warzone will continue to be supported with content based on the year's new Call of Duty game."We're in kind of uncharted territories here," Kurosaki told GamerGen. "Call of Duty has been on a very regular cadence for many many years, and Warzone has made us rethink exactly how best to release new content and how to integrate it. Call of Duty is a genre in itself, there are different branches in the Call of Duty tree, but they're all connected in some ways. Warzone will be the throughline that connects all of the different various sub-franchises of Call of Duty."Kurosaki further teased that he's excited to see how the various other Call of Duty games get incorporated into Warzone as the years go on."It's going to be really cool to see how the different sub-franchises sort of come in and out of focus, but Warzone will be the one constant," he said.Activision has a track record of supporting multiple CoD games at once. Black Ops 4, for instance, continues to receive new events, although the majority of new CoD content is focused on Modern Warfare, Warzone, and CoD Mobile.2020's new Call of Duty game is reportedly a Cold War/Vietnam-era Black Ops spin-off from Treyarch with the support of Sledgehammer Games and Raven Software. It is expected that it will be a cross-generation title, releasing for PS4, Xbox One, and PC, as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X.Warzone is Call of Duty's second battle royale experience, following the Blackout mode that was featured in 2018's Black Ops 4. The situation is different, however, as Blackout is only available to people who bought Black Ops 4, while Warzone is a free-to-play standalone game.
Demand for housing is high, but there aren’t enough homes for sale to meet it.Pending home sales, which measure signed contracts, fell 1.7% in October month-to-month, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were 4.4% higher annually, likely because mortgage rates are much lower this fall.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was about a full percentage point lower this October than it was a year ago. Rates did move slightly higher in October, which could account for some of the monthly drop, but a shortage of homes for sale is more of the culprit. Lower rates overall this year have juiced demand significantly, causing for-sale inventory to fall. Inventory had been rising at the start of this year, due to last year’s rate spike.“We still need to address and, more importantly, correct inadequate levels of inventory across the country,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the NAR. “There is no shortage of buyers seeking homes, but a lack of available units continues to drag down the nation’s housing market and overall economy.”Sales of newly built homes, which are also measured by signed contracts, were significantly higher in October compared with a year October 2018. Builders are seeing strong demand and are trying to shift production to more affordable homes. Housing starts are still not where they need to be, however, to meet demand.“We risk a lingering shortage of sufficient inventory if homebuilding only continues at its current pace over the next 20 years, when the U.S. population is projected to increase by more than 40 million over this period. Clearly, home builders must step in and construct more housing,” added Yun.Regionally, pending home sales in the Northeast rose 1.9% for the month and were 3% higher annually. In the Midwest sales fell 2.7% monthly but were 1.8% higher annually. Sales in the South decreased 1.7% monthly but were up 5.1% from a year ago. In the West, pending home sales fell 3.4% for the month but were 7.5% higher than October 2018.
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Scuffles broke out between demonstrators and police in Hong Kong on Thursday as hundreds of people kept up a protest against a planned extradition law with mainland China, a day after police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to break up big crowds.Protests around the city’s legislature on Wednesday forced the postponement of debate on the extradition bill, which many people in Hong Kong fear will undermine freedoms and confidence in the commercial hub.Hong Kong’s China-backed Chief Executive Carrie Lam condemned the violence and urged a swift restoration of order but has vowed to press ahead with the legislation despite the reservations about it, including within the business community.The number of protesters milling about outside the legislature in the financial district fell overnight but rose again through the day on Thursday to about 1,000 at one stage.They expect the legislature, which has a majority of pro-Beijing members, will try to hold the debate at some stage, though it issued a notice saying there would be no session on Thursday.
With Britain in lockdown, the Government has been racing to find ways to ease restrictions without putting public safety at risk.  One solution is a contact-tracing app that can enable digital contact-tracing on a large scale.The government has revealed of the app, which will be tested on the Isle of Wight and then launched to the rest of the UK in June, if it proves successful. The app went live on the island on May 5.The UK is planning to use trained teams to find people who have coronavirus symptoms, working with the Army to make thousands of calls a day to track the spread of Covid-19, all of which will be complemented by the contact-tracing app.But Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has faced criticism for so far recruiting only 1,500 contact tracers of the Government's 18,000 target by mid-May.And contact tracers are only being hired by the Government for an initial three months - seemingly running contrary to the advice of health experts, who predict the staff will be needed for up to 18 months to assist in controlling the spread of the virus.But what exactly is contract tracing, can it really help lift the lockdown measures, and when will it be available? What is it and how does it work?A contact-tracing app is designed to let people know if they have been in close contact with someone who later reports positive for Covid-19.It could pinpoint exactly who needs to be in quarantine and who doesn’t, making it key to easing up social distancing measures. The purpose of the contact-tracing app is to try and track down people and alert them of the need to self-isolate faster than traditional methods.Users who download the app to their phone can voluntarily opt-in to record details of their symptoms when they start to feel unwell. The app keeps a trace of others who have been in close contact through Bluetooth signals that transmit an anonymous ID. These low energy Bluetooth signals perform a digital "handshake" when two users come into close contact, but keep that data anonymous. If an individual later reports that they are positive for coronavirus, it will then ping a message to people who have been in close-contact with them in the last 28 days based on their anonymous IDs. The app will recommend those people self-isolate in case they have contracted the disease. Those contacted won't know the identity of the person who may have passed on coronavirus.If the person then takes a test and tests negative, they may be released from their self-isolation by a notification through the app.For trials on the Isle of Wight, people who voluntarily report their symptoms will be brought a testing kit within 24 hours, the government has said.The data will not be stored longer than 28 days and the NHSX has said it will be deleted after the app's use is finished and the pandemic is over.The NHS's technology and research arm NHSX has developed the app with researchers from Oxford University and using developers from tech companies like VMWare. It has also been in contact with Apple and Google, although it is using different technology to those technology companies and has rejected their approach.The technology the NHS has built will allow smartphones to track every other device they have come into contact with in the 28 days using Bluetooth signals.Records of contacts will be stored on phones. If a user comes down with coronavirus symptoms they report this in the app. That data is then shared with a health service database and their anonymous ID matched with other phones they have come into contact with.  People who they have been in close contact with will then be sent a notification urging them to isolate.This data will not be linked to people’s names but use anonymous IDs linked to a device, so phone owners will not know who might have passed on the virus. They will, however, be asked to share the first digits of their post code.When will it launch? The app is currently not available widely, but launched on the Isle of Wight on May 5. NHSX chief executive Matthew Gould said the app will be two to three weeks away for the rest of the country. It is now expected to be launched to the rest of the UK in June if the test on the Isle of Wight proves successful.Matthew Hancock, the health secretary, said that people on the Isle of Wight would be written to with details on how to down load the app from the government. He said the slogan for the NHS would be: “Stay at home, install the app,  protect the NHS, and save lives.”Will the app track GPS or need mobile data?The NHS app uses Bluetooth signals to check for contacts. This means it does not need to connect to mobile data when you are out and about. For now the app does not track GPS signals.The NHS said it might introduce a system of monitoring location data in future to collect useful data on the pandemic, but that would be voluntary.Some privacy experts have raised concerns that patient confidentiality risks being compromised.Dr Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, head of the Computational Privacy Group at Imperial College London, has warned that such apps could “collect sensitive information like location data”. “We need to do everything we can to help slow the outbreak. Contact tracing requires handling very sensitive data at scale, and solid and proven techniques exist to help us do it while protecting our fundamental right to privacy. We cannot afford to not use them,” he said. Mr Hancock has pushed back against the privacy concerns, claiming that data would only be held as long as it was needed and that “all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards”.“If you become unwell you can securely tell this new NHS app, and the app will then send an alert anonymously to other app users who you’ve been in significant contact with,” the health secretary said. Have other countries made something similar?In Singapore, a contact-tracing app called TraceTogether has been rolled out by the government to track those who might be infected by coronavirus.Since March 20 it has been downloaded over 800,000 times in the hopes of creating a “community-driven” response to the virus. What are Apple and Google doing?The two tech giants have teamed up to offer each country a piece of technology that will help turn all iPhones and all Android phones (apart from newer Huawei devices) into contact tracing devices.Apps that use the API (which must be made by a public official) send users “exposure notifications” if they have been in contact with someone who contracted coronavirus. The system records contact as when a smartphone is within a couple of feet of another device for up to 10 minutes. Bluetooth wireless technology can sense devices from up to 15 ft away.Even if people from different countries or states have different contact tracing apps, the system is interoperable and will be able to alert them to exposure. Authorities that want to collect location data of people will not be allowed to use the technology, but are open to building their own. In coming months, they will integrate the technology directly into their operating systems to reach more people. Their tools will be “decentralised” and not send data to central health authorities, but will instead pass it from phone to phone.Google said that the tools would be added to Android via a download in the Google Play store. Apple will offer it via an iOS software update. Apple said the goal is to make it compatible with as many iPhones as possible, including older models.The functionality will only be available to public health apps so outsider developers won’t be able to use that data. It also means that users will have to download an official app to input test results. 
Pitcher plants are even more carnivorous than we imagined, regularly feasting on salamanders, a new study shows for the first time.Vertebrates, ranging from frogs to rats, have been seen in the sticky jaws of pitcher plants before, but were “thought to be a rare prey trapped accidentally,” says Kazuki Tagawa, an ecologist from Tottori College in Kurayoshi, Japan, who wasn’t involved in the research.That’s why Tagawa was so surprised by the discovery, published recently in the journal Ecology.Study leader Patrick Moldowan, an ecologist at the University of Toronto in Ontario, Canada, was making his rounds of a bog in Algonquin Provincial Park in August 2018 when he spotted the bizarre behaviour. “The very first plant that I kneeled down and peered into had captured a salamander, and it was alive and swimming,” he says.Interest piqued, he and his colleagues spent the next month and a half peeking into the contents of northern pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea). The team observed juvenile spotted salamanders in almost 20 percent of plants surveyed; many traps contained more than one, with a total count of 35 individuals.The scientists believe the amphibians provide a big boost of nutrients in food-scarce, highly acidic bogs, where carnivorous plants have evolved to live. The newly recorded behavior may also be a concern for spotted salamander populations, which already occur in low densities throughout Ontario’s bogs.Salamander seasonPitcher plants typically use nectar to attract prey such as pollinating insects, which fall into a tiny pool of water at the plant’s base, where they’re slowly digested. It’s possible the salamanders ended up in the pools while seeking refuge, or they were drawn to insects attracted by the plant. “In turn, with one wrong slip, they themselves could become the meal,” says Moldowan.In any case, he says it’s strange that the behaviour wasn’t noticed before, since these pitcher plants and salamanders are both common species.That may be because previous studies have typically examined the plants’ contents in spring and summer, while the salamanders seem to fall victim to the plants in late summer and early fall—the period during which they metamorphosise and are transitioning from an aquatic to terrestrial habitat.There’s likely a seasonal component to the pitcher plants’ predation, too: Cold can settle in as early as September, and such large prey would be a huge benefit when insects become scarce in winter. (Read about the world’s largest carnivorous plant.)“Compared to any sort of invertebrate life that these plants might capture, salamanders offer hundreds to thousands of times more in nutrient inputs—things like nitrogen and phosphorus,” says Moldowan.Catching salamanders could have a downside for the plants, though: Large prey can rot in a trap before it is fully digested, potentially killing the plant.Tagawa is interested in how efficiently a pitcher plant can digest a salamander following its capture, which hasn’t yet been investigated. According to the new study, it took between three and 19 days for salamanders to die inside the plant. They may be literally cooked to death when the small pool of water heats up in the sun, says Moldowan.Expanding the menuThe findings could have repercussions for spotted salamander populations on top of water pollution and habitat loss, the authors say. So far, however, the amphibian’s numbers do not seem to be declining, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the species as of least concern.Going forward, Moldowan plans to research “whether these big pulses of nutrients benefit the plant in growth in the next year.”He also wants to find out if pitcher plants frequently tuck into other vertebrates; he didn’t find frogs or toads in his recent survey, possibly because it was the wrong time of year.“This year, I'll more specifically try to address that by sampling over a wider period of time,” says Moldowan.“This is probably a much more widespread phenomenon than we currently recognize.”
President Trump bashed the World Health Organization [WHO] on Sunday, saying the group mishandled the coronavirus pandemic by giving deference to China, during his Fox News Town Hall with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, focused on reopening America during the public health crisis.Trump answered questions submitted by Fox News viewers on Twitter, Facebook and InstagramQuestion: Are you considering new tariffs to punish China? “The World Health Organization has been a disaster,” Trump said.Trump said the WHO passed along “wrong” information and was China-centric. Trump noted that the United States “foolishly” has been paying the group $450 million a year whereas China has been paying $38 million a year.“But, the [WHO] were more political than all of our leaders previously,” Trump said. “What the WHO did, they missed every single call.”Question: “Is there enough evidence that China misled the global community about this coronavirus? If so, how should the global community respond?“Don’t forget, China tried to blame the [coronavirus pandemic] on some of our soldiers and that didn’t go too far,” Trump noted, a reference to statements appearing on Chinese state media. Trump said China then tried to blame it on Europe as Italy “suffered probably more than anybody per capita.”Trump also said China made a “horrible mistake and they did not want to admit it.”
Households have been told to brace themselves for the worst recession in living memory as the brutal impact of Covid-19 becomes clearer.With Prime Minister Boris Johnson preparing to lay out plans to get people back to work, details of the damage already inflicted by the lockdown on vast swathes of the economy have emerged.A closely watched survey revealed the UK's dominant services sector, which encompasses everything from restaurants and hotels to airlines, contracted at the fastest pace on record last month.The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for services – where anything below 50 represents decline – dropped to 13.4 in April.This is by far the worst score since the survey started in 1996, and well below the 40.1 recorded in the depths of the financial crisis in November 2008.Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said: 'The downturn in the UK during the second quarter of 2020 will be far deeper and more widespread than anything seen in living memory.'It is feared economic output could fall by as much as 35 per cent in the current second quarter of the year.The damage inflicted on Britain's once booming motor industry also became clearer, as figures showed just 4,321 new cars were sold in April.That was down 97 per cent on a year earlier and the lowest number since 1946, according to the figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).The lockdown has led to car showrooms and factories being closed and many customers being housebound.The brutal impact of the pandemic means the auto industry is on course for its worst year since 1992, when the UK economy was in recession.SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: 'The market's worst performance in living memory is hardly surprising.'These figures, however, still make for exceptionally grim reading, not least for the hundreds of thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the sector.'The lockdown enforced on March 23 has helped to stop the spread of the deadly Covid-19 but has paralysed large swathes of the economy and put vast numbers of companies on the brink.One in ten firms – some 591,000 businesses – are at high risk of going bust as a result of the pandemic, according to analysis published today.The report, by the CEBR thinktank and polling company Opinium, also warned more than a quarter of a million firms will not survive if the lockdown lasts for another month.But it warned a second wave of infections and a subsequent lockdown 'could prove fatal for the business community'.Based on a poll of more than 500 firms, it predicted 1.1m companies could not survive another three months of lockdown. Pablo Shah, senior economist at CEBR, said that the findings 'provide the first glimpse of the deep and long-term scars that the coronavirus crisis is set to inflict upon the UK economy'.And a hard-hitting report by the Resolution Foundation warned youth unemployment could rise by 600,000 this year and 'scar' the long-term prospects of a generation. It predicted the figure could top one million, more than doubling the current level of 408,000.With around 800,000 people aged between 18 and 24 set to leave education this year, the report warned the 'corona class of 2020' could face years of reduced pay and limited prospects.But it also warned that younger people who have just joined the workforce, including recent graduates, are more likely to be made redundant as many firms adopt a 'last in, first out' policy. 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would see nothing wrong in accepting damaging information on a U.S. political opponent if it were offered to his re-election campaign by a foreign government.Asked in an interview with ABC News if he would accept the information or alert the FBI, Trump said: “I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen, there’s nothing wrong with listening.”“If somebody called from a country, Norway, ‘we have information on your opponent’ - oh, I think I’d want to hear it,” Trump said.Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. was questioned by a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday in a closed session about a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York in which a Russian lawyer had offered damaging information on Hillary Clinton, the elder Trump’s Democratic opponent in the 2016 presidential election.The younger Trump, on learning the topic of the meeting, had written in an email: “I love it.” But people who attended the meeting said later it focussed on other matters.Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigated the meeting as part of his probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. He documented extensive contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia, but did not establish that members of the campaign conspired with Moscow.Speaking to ABC News on Wednesday, Trump said he disagreed with FBI Director Christopher Wray, who told Congress last month that political campaigns should contact the agency about any suspicious communications from a foreign government.“The FBI director is wrong,” Trump said.“I’ve seen a lot of things over my life. I don’t think in my whole life I’ve ever called the FBI. In my whole life. You don’t call the FBI. You throw somebody out of your office, you do whatever you do,” Trump said. “Oh, give me a break – life doesn’t work that way.”Trump compared damaging information on an opponent supplied by a foreign government to opposition research conducted by all political campaigns.“It’s not an interference, they have information - I think I’d take it,” Trump said. “If I thought there was something wrong, I’d go maybe to the FBI - if I thought there was something wrong.”
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was discharged from a hospital in Georgia on Wednesday after a successful surgery to relieve pressure on his brain, heading home one day before the Thanksgiving holiday.Carter, 95, had been hospitalized at Emory University in Atlanta in the latest episode in a string of recent health scares for the nation’s oldest living former president.He was released on Wednesday morning “after successful surgery and recovery to relieve pressure on his brain caused by a subdural hematoma,” the Carter Center said in a statement.“He and Mrs. Carter look forward to enjoying Thanksgiving at home in Plains, where he will continue to recover. The Carters are grateful for all the prayers, cards, and notes they have received and hope everyone will join them in enjoying a special Thanksgiving,” the center said in a statement.A Nobel Peace Prize winner, Carter has become an internationally known humanitarian and global fixture following his one-term presidency, which ended in early 1981.He has continued to do work for the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity despite his recent health scares, including recent falls at his Georgia home that led to a minor pelvic fracture and bleeding.
Good Morning Britain 's Dr Hilary Jones has confirmed Piers Morgan "doesn't have symptoms normally associated with Covid-19" but got tested as a "precaution".The newsman, 55, has stepped away from the show after falling sick over the weekend and won't be returning until gets his test result back.Dr Hilary has now revealed he spoke to Piers yesterday and the GMB host explained his symptoms over the phone.The TV medic admits what Piers described is not usually linked to Covid-19, but he took the test anyway just to be safe.Speaking on GMB today, Dr Hilary said: "I spoke to Piers yesterday and he doesn't have symptoms that are normally associated with covid-19 but as he says, with an abundance of caution, he's taken a test."He was replaced by Ben Shephard on today's show, who joked: "Does he just want a lie-in, Hilary?"The doctor then quipped: "I think he probably wants to get his car clean".Just weeks ago, Piers clashed with Dr Hilary after the medic told him the lockdown rules means he can't go outside to clean his beloved car.Piers said: "Can I wash my Aston Martin in the street? The windows are all getting filthy and I have to drive myself to work."I imagine there's a lot of people out there who are driving, not Aston Martins, but vans, lorries."What is the rule? There are no car washes open. Are you allowed under government guidelines to wash your car?"Dr Hilary insisted that no one should be washing their car on the street as it poses an unnecessary risk.The doctor said: "Washing your car is unessential apart from the windscreen for safety. Leave your car dirty for the timebeing."On Sunday, Piers told fans he'd have to take a step back from GMB after suffering mild symptoms and was awaiting the result of a test.He tweeted: "UPDATE: On medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs..."I've had a test for COVID-19 and so won’t be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow."Piers didn't go into what symptoms he had experienced, but did reveal he was going by medical advice.His colleague Susanna Reid was forced to miss two weeks of GMB in March, after her son came down with a cough.On this morning's GBM, Pies was replaced by Ben Shephard, who introduced the show saying: "As you can see, I'm not Piers!""Yes, it's therapeutic," Susanna quipped.Susanna added: "We send our very best wishes and we'll be on our best behaviour while he's not here." 
The comic book creator of Thanos has called the US President a "pompous fool" after one of his team's Twitter accounts shared a video of the president as the Marvel mega-villain.Writer and artist Jim Starlin, who created Thanos in 1973, told The Hollywood Reporter he felt violated after seeing Donald Trump use his creation for his latest campaign."After my initial feeling of being violated, seeing that pompous fool using my creation to stroke his infantile ego, it finally struck me that the leader of my country and the free world actually enjoys comparing himself to a mass murderer," Starlin said.The video came hours after House Democrats announced two articles of impeachment against Trump on Tuesday.The response posted from the Trump War Room account saw him take on the Marvel villain with his head attached to Thanos's body and obliterate a group of Democrats.It was captioned: "House Democrats can push their sham impeachment all they want. President Trump's re-election is inevitable."The original scene Trump parodied comes from 2019's "Avengers: Endgame," when Thanos says "I am inevitable" and snaps his fingers in an attempt to destroy all existing life in the Universe. "How sick is that? These are sad and strange times we are going through. Fortunately, all things, even national nightmares, eventually come to an end," Starlin told The Hollywood Reporter. Trump's pop culture referenced tweet isn't the first to be posted by a politician this week. On Tuesday the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsion imitated a scene from the Christmas classic "Love Actually" for his Brexit campaign video.
Former Vice President Joe Biden responded Thursday to a doctored video posted by President Donald Trump mocking Biden's physical interactions in light of allegations that his behavior has made women feel uncomfortable."I see that you are on the job and presidential, as always," Biden tweeted in response to Trump's tweet.Biden says in the clip, "I shake hands, I hug people, I grab men and women by the shoulders and say, 'You can do this,' " as an animation of the former vice president comes up behind him and grasps his shoulders. Trump captioned the video, "WELCOME BACK JOE!"The back-and-forth comes as Biden and his team prepare for a potential bid to challenge Trump in 2020. Biden is expected to make an announcement about his plans this month.During the 2016 campaign, at least 15 women accused Trump of misbehavior ranging from sexual harassment and sexual assault to lewd behavior around women. Most came forward in the wake of a 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape that was released in October 2016, in which he is caught saying on a hot mic: "And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab them by the p****. You can do anything."Trump has repeatedly denied the allegations.Biden currently faces allegations from multiple women that his physical behavior made them uncomfortable. Former Nevada state Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, the first woman to come forward, alleged that Biden had kissed the back of her head at a 2014 Nevada campaign rally, making her feel "uneasy, gross, and confused."In the full video of Biden addressing his interactions with voters -- released after statements from both him and a campaign official -- he emphasizes that he both wants to connect with people and understands changing social norms."I've never thought of politics as cold and antiseptic," he said in the video, posted Wednesday. "I've always thought it about connecting with people, as I said, shaking hands, hands on the shoulder, a hug, encouragement, and now, it's all about taking selfies together.""You know, social norms have begun to change, they've shifted, and the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset, and I get it, I get it," he added.
Now that the Bears have done the expected and declined the quarterback’s fifth-year option for 2021, the 2017 No. 2 overall pick is on the clock.        Mitch Trubisky can be Kevin White or Kyle Fuller.Now that the Bears have done the expected and declined his fifth-year option for 2021, the 2017 No. 2 overall pick is on the clock.He has a year to fight for his place with the organization.That begins with winning the starting job. The Bears say he’ll take the first snap of the first practice — whenever that may be — but their offseason moves showed how little faith they have in him. They traded a fourth-round pick for Nick Foles, giving him at least $21 million over three years, because they think he’ll be needed.Whether Trubisky wins the job will chart his course toward White or Fuller.        The Bears’ declining of White’s fifth-year option two years ago was their most obvious move of the decade. In three years, the No. 7 pick of the 2015 draft had only 21 catches for 193 yards.The Bears signed Allen Robinson and Taylor Gabriel in March 2018. A month later, they traded up to draft Anthony Miller in the second round. They didn’t need White anymore and weren’t going to count on him to produce. White was a healthy scratch in seven games in 2018. He caught four balls for 92 yards — but one was a 54-yard Hail Mary that fell a yard short of the goal line against the Patriots. He left after the 2018 season and hasn’t played a regular-season snap since.        Three years ago, general manager Ryan Pace decided to decline Fuller’s fifth-year option. Former GM Phil Emery’s last first-round pick had missed all of the previous season after having arthroscopic knee surgery in August. Pace signed veteran Marcus Cooper to a three-year, $16 million deal, not willing to rely on Fuller to take the next step.Fuller began 2017 as the starter because of Prince Amukamara’s injury, then started for Cooper when he hurt his back before Week 5. Fuller never looked back.“He has helped resurrect his career,” defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said then.Fuller was so valuable by the end of 2017 that the Bears issued him the transition tag, which would have paid him $12.97 million in 2018. He wound up making even more when the Packers signed him to a four-year, $56 million offer that the Bears quickly matched.If Trubisky plays as well in 2020 as Fuller did in 2017, the Bears could use a similar mechanism to keep him in place. The 2021 franchise tag will cost at least $3 million more than the $24.8 million the Bears would have otherwise owed Trubisky — but the team would likely be thrilled to pay it. Presuming, of course, that the Bears don’t need to use it on Robinson, whose contract extension has yet to materialize this offseason.Only one top-five pick from 2017 — No. 1 overall selection Myles Garrett — had his option picked up. But Trubisky is the only one in the group compared to the Chiefs’ Patrick Mahomes and the Texans’ Deshaun Watson, who will soon negotiate contracts to override their fifth-year options. Still, a world exists — if the Bears have the appetite to run the ball and tight ends to catch it — in which Trubisky could be a competent starter.In that sense, he’s probably closer to ex-Bear Leonard Floyd, a 2016 first-round pick, than White or Fuller. Trubisky and Floyd have otherworldly athleticism for their positions, but it hasn’t translated on Sundays.The Bears picked up Floyd’s option last year but cut him before he could play his fifth season after watching him get only three sacks.The Bears decided Floyd simply wasn’t good enough.Trubisky’s bosses have pointed him down the same path. He has a year to change their minds.
Astronomers have been urged to broaden their search for life on other worlds as new research shows that organisms found on Earth can survive in environments previously considered inhospitable.Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that microorganisms grow in atmospheres composed entirely of hydrogen. The findings are likely to influence the search for life on worlds beyond our own, they said. A significant number of rocky exoplanets — those orbiting stars other than our Sun — are expected to have a lot of atmospheric hydrogen.Such hydrogen-rich atmospheres are likely to be larger than Earth’s nitrogen-rich equivalent, making these exoplanets easier to detect with a new generation of very powerful observatories, such as Nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope, a successor to the
(Reuters) - U.S. health officials said on Thursday four more deaths occurred since last week from a mysterious respiratory illness tied to vaping, taking the total toll to 52.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also reported 118 more hospitalized cases from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories, as of Dec. 10. The number of people hospitalized now stands at 2,409.The deaths have been confirmed in 26 states and the District of Columbia.U.S. officials last month reported the discovery of Vitamin E acetate — believed to be used as a cutting agent in illicit vaping products containing marijuana components — in all lung samples from 29 patients.CDC has called Vitamin E acetate as a “chemical of concern” and recommended that the substance not be added to e-cigarette, or vaping products, while the investigation is ongoing.
Jessica Biel is clarifying why she traveled to Sacramento this week to meet with lawmakers as the California state house reviewed a new bill that has been opposed by anti-vaccine advocates. Biel appeared alongside vaccination skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who shared photos of her visit on social media."Please say thank you to the courageous @jessicabiel for a busy and productive day at the California State House,"  Kennedy Jr. wrote on Instagram Wednesday, along with a series of photos of him and Biel smiling in the state house.Following criticism of Biel's appearance with Kennedy, the 37-year-old actress shared an Instagram post Thursday clarifying her stance on vaccines, writing, "I am not against vaccinations — I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians."Biel wrote she was lobbying against the bill due to its handling of medical exemptions, which she views as harmful."My dearest friends have a child with a medical condition that warrants an exemption from vaccinations, and should this bill pass, it would greatly affect their family’s ability to care for their child in this state," she wrote. "That’s why I spoke to legislators and argued against this bill. Not because I don’t believe in vaccinations, but because I believe in giving doctors and the families they treat the ability to decide what’s best for their patients and the ability to provide that treatment."The bill seeks to limit medical exemptions from vaccinations, with opponents claiming the new policies would make it harder for parents to avoid rules requiring children to receive vaccinations before entering elementary school.The bill arrives at the California statehouse amid a national rise in cases of measles, mumps, pertussis (whooping cough), tuberculosis and other infectious diseases that were all-but-eliminated by modern medicine, with experts attributing the return to parents choosing not to vaccinate their children.More: Anti-vaxxers open door for measles, mumps, other old-time diseases back from near extinctionIn an interview with the Daily Beast,  Kennedy claimed that Biel supported "safe vaccines" and "medical freedom."“She was a very effective advocate,” Kennedy said of the actress. “She was very strong and very knowledgeable. Extremely well-informed. An extremely effective advocate. She knows what she’s talking about… She’s upset about this issue because of its particular cruelty. She has friends who have been vaccine-injured who would be forced to leave the state.”Kennedy, the son of Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy, is the founder of anti-vaccination organization Children’s Health Defense, which has led campaigns and petitions arguing that children should not be vaccinated.Several Hollywood names praised Biel's involvement in the comments of Kennedy's Instagram post. Kimberly Van Der Beek, wife of James Van Der Beek, thanked Biel for "enlightening people with grounded information and science today," while Rosanna Arquette wrote, "Thank you Jessica."The same post was met with widespread criticism on social media.Seth MacFarlane didn't mention Biel or Kennedy Jr. by name, but tweeted his opposition to the general anti-vaccination movement, writing, "Refusing to vaccinate your children cannot be justified by “personal belief.” You’re endangering their health and the health of the public. Your right to your “belief” ends where it harms others. Or as they say: “Your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins.”"One of the many reasons I absolutely fume over this stuff is that celebrities have *so* much influence and one Jessica Biel can drown out the wisdom of 100s of doctors/scientists," one commenter wrote, with another joking, "I disagree with Jessica Biel about vaccinations, but she'll still remain my #1 source for all other medical information." Biel has one child, 4-year-old son Silas Randall, with her husband Justin Timberlake. Biel and Timberlake have not previously spoken about vaccinations or whether they chose to vaccinate their child.
As millions of us continue to stay inside, it’s vital that broadband speeds are up to scratch. Working from home, video calls, streaming radio stations and songs as well as bingeing on endless boxsets on Netflix can place huge pressure internet connections and that action can bring things to a shuddering halt. But is it just what goes on inside your home that impacts your connection?Sky  has offered its customers useful advice, which explains exactly why its broadband users could find things slower than expected. The satellite firm has a dedicated webpage with advice about why things change so dramatically.Perhaps one of the biggest reasons speeds aren’t always as good as you’d hope is due to the age and quality of the physical line coming into your home. If your street only has an old copper connection, it won’t be anywhere near as fast as the latest fibre technology.Things can also be affected by how far you live away from the exchange with speeds getting much worse the further away you are from the original source.Without digging up the tarmac outside of your home on a quiet weekend, you clearly cannot change the wires that pump broadband to your router but the next tip can be controlled by you. As Sky explains, the web is a bit like a motorway, when there’s less traffic passing along it you can go faster but add more users and things will begin to slow.One of the worst offenders for web traffic are big uploads. So if you are trying to make a video call to your boss and your kids are trying to create their first 4K YouTube channel – you could be in trouble.It’s worth remembering everything you connect to your broadband hub uses bandwidth. The more you connect, the more it slows you down. And don’t forget those things running in the background, like app updates, device backups, Google Photo uploads, and all those open browser tabs – all of these could impact speeds.Shut them down if not being used. And always keep your WIFi password on - it stops anyone else using your WiFi.The latest home technology, such as Smart TVs, Sky Q, smart lighting and connected sound systems, app-controlled thermostats ... all these use your bandwidth, so you’ll need to make sure your internet speed can handle all these devices.It’s a good idea to check each of your device’s minimum requirements and consider upgrading your package if you have too many devices on your network. One final thing to try is moving your router.Things can get an instant boost by simply moving this device off the ground and making sure it’s not near any other gadgets which could affect the signal.Sky’s advice is to keep the router out in the open - not in a cabinet, on the floor or stuck behind the TV. For the best results, 30cm of space around it’s best.Another way to make sure you get the best download speeds is to get as close to your router as possible. Sitting next to this black box will give you a better connection than when you head outside to your garden shed.If things are still terrible then it’s worth keeping a daily record of your speed using services such as speedtest.net. As part of Sky’s commitment to Ofcom’s Better Broadband Speeds, Voluntary Code of Practice, you might be entitled to cancel your contract if your actual speed falls below the one they told you when you joined. 
Hello and welcome back to our regular morning look at private companies, public markets and the grey space in between.This morning we’re digging into the current IPO market, asking ourselves how much damage WeWork really did to other companies hoping to go public. Is the IPO window closed, and if not, what sort of companies can still get out?There’s some good news out today for late-stage startups looking to debut — along with a few impending tests regarding the market’s appetite for risk that we should understand as we head into 2020.Bill.com’s good newsIn terms of IPOs, Bill.com’s felt comfortably standard for 2019. Bill.com  was a heavily venture-backed company that had raised just under $350 million while private across myriad rounds, and by the time it wanted to go public it still lost money.At the same time, the company had a number of strengths. These include historically slim losses as a percent of revenue ($7.3 million in its most recent fiscal year, against $78.4 million in revenue), differentiated revenue sources (subscription income and rising interest payments), and improving gross margins (74 percent in its most recent quarter, up from a little under 72 percent in the year-ago period).Those factors combined were sufficient to entice investors to price the company’s IPO far above its initial expectations of $16 to $18 per share. Instead, Bill.com raised its range once and then priced above the higher interval. At $22 per share, the company’s value rose by about 60% compared to its most recent private financing. (You can read more on the debut here.)This matters as WeWork was said to have closed the IPO window for companies more focused on growth than profits. The way the market reality was discussed in venture circles seemed to indicate that WeWork’s implosion had slashed investor interest in growth, with public market players now favoring profits, or something close.Bill.com’s most recent three-month period featured far-larger losses than its year-ago quarter, which mattered little in the end. The firm’s solid growth and moderate losses, it seems, were more than enough to secure a strong welcome to the public markets.Yes, but…You may be wondering why we just spent so much time explaining why a healthy company managed to go public. The goal, simply, was to point out that not only can companies still losing money and burning cash go public, they may even get a strong reception.But what about companies in slightly less good shape? What does Bill.com’s IPO pricing indicate for Sprout Social, a company of similar size that’s going public this week which is also unprofitable, but growing more slowly (29.5% year-over-year in Q3 2019, compared to Bill.com’s 57%)?Its pricing and debut will be a more interesting test. And luckily for us, it should price its shares this evening. (Even more fun, it targeted the same $16 to $18 per-share initial IPO price range that Bill.com initially had in its own sights.)If Sprout Social manages to price in-range, we’ll have another data point in favor of the IPO window being comfortably open. It’s not surprising that Bill.com’s IPO priced well, but Sprout Social’s slower growth rate likely make its losses less palatable; if it can debut all the same we’ll know that the band of venture-backed companies that can public post-WeWork in the dead of December is wide.That’s good news for illiquid unicorns and their backers, provided that their companies are at least as healthy as Chicago’s Sprout.WeWork 2.0Finally, we have one more test of the IPO market ahead of us.China-based Ucommune is a co-working company with self-described “global impact and ambitions.” Claiming to be the “largest co-working space community in China,” Ucommune espouses “sharing, innovation, responsibility and success for all.” In its F-1 document, filed yesterday and setting in motion a possible US-listed IPO, Ucommune details comical levels of unprofitability and growth.If all that sounds familiar, it should. It should feel similar to WeWork, which makes the timing of Ucommune’s IPO filing all the more amazing. WeWork’s pulled IPO was minutes ago, and here we are, staring down the filing of yet another coworking IPO?The situation gets even better. Observe the following results:Ucommune Q1, Q2, Q3 revenue: $122.4 million
A ban on hot desking and employee "health passports" are amongst the measures being considered by the Government to get Britain back to work.Draft Whitehall documents propose closing office lifts and canteens and putting tape on the floor to mark where people should stand.Extra cleaning should be introduced in office spaces and the use of protective equipment should be considered where maintaining a distance of two metres between workers is not possible.Customer-facing employees could be guarded by plastic screens, while continued home working and staggered shifts should also be encouraged, the guidance says.The proposals by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) are among a list of guidelines in seven documents drawn up after consultation with executives, trade bodies and unions.The Financial Times reported that firms will also be told to lay on more parking spaces so that staff do not have to rely on lifts from colleagues.Millions of companies will have to draw up a Covid-19 "risk assessment" before allowing staff to return to work, the documents suggest.The guidance also says social distancing will have to be maintained, whether on the shop floor, in shopping queues, or in communal spaces.A Government spokesman said: "The Business Secretary continues to work with businesses, union leaders and the science and medical community so we can ensure workplaces are safe for those who will go back to work once the measures are relaxed and give people the confidence to return to work."But business leaders said clarity is needed on issues such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and whether firms can be held liable even if they fulfil their obligations to protect employees from coronavirus.Director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce Adam Marshall said the issue is one of the "key questions we've asked".He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "They (bosses) will want to know that they're not going to be held liable for horrible things that may unfortunately happen if they've done everything in their power to keep their people safe.Mr Marshall also said there is a need for "clear guidance" on PPE."No business wants to be competing with the health services or with the care sector, for example, for PPE," he told Today.A UK-wide procurement strategy will be "hugely important" in order to source and manufacture the necessary PPE, he added.Here, are what the nation's workplaces might look like once restrictions are lifted.OfficesSince the lockdown conditions were first imposed on March 23, most of the nation's office workers have become accustomed to working from home.However, companies that are eager for workers to return to the office will need to make a number of changes in order to ensure the health and safety of staff is not compromised.According to the BBC, staggered shift times, less sharing of equipment and continued maximisation of home working are among a number of ideas listed as part of a draft government strategy to help businesses prepare for a return to work.Increased hygiene procedures and the installation of protective screens are also included in the plan.Meanwhile, the Guardian says ministers are holding talks with technology firms over the creation of "health passports" which use "coronavirus testing and facial recognition" to prove which workers have had Covid-19.RetailLast month, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) published guidance for measures that retail stores could introduce to help with the transition once restrictions are lifted.The recommended measures include limiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.BRC chief Helen Dickinson said the guidance measures would serve to ensure the safety and well-being of both customers and staff."Since the lockdown, many retailers have proved how shops can be run safely and effectively in line with the Government's social distancing advice," she said."Continued close collaboration with Government, including public support for the steps retailers are taking and adequate notice to get supply chains up and running, will mean that retail businesses can start trading again slowly and safely, and customers can feel confident that they are safe to return to shops."Public transportPublic transport is one of the biggest issues for many people as they prepare to return to the office.Speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show, Transport Secretary Grant Shapp said increased bus and train timetables will be implemented to help the public transport system cope with an influx in passengers while still adhering to social distancing recommendations."The first thing is, obviously, we'll expand the number of trains and buses running," Mr Shapps said.He also pointed to active transport methods such as cycling as a way for people to take more personal responsibility over their welfare."The second thing to say is active travel, I think, is a very important part of this, by which I mean cycling, walking and so on," he said."There's been a massive increase ... hundreds of percent more people using the existing scheme where you can go to your employer and ask for a bike which you pay back through the loan and effectively before you pay tax, and that's a very popular scheme and I think active transport, active mobility is something we've been doing a lot more of."AirportsHeathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye has warned that the nation's major international airports do not have enough space for social distancing to be a solution for safe travel post-lockdown."Forget social distancing - it won't work in aviation or any other form of public transport, and the problem is not the plane, it is the lack of space in the airport," he wrote in the Daily Telegraph."Just one jumbo jet would require a queue a kilometre long."Instead, Mr Holland-Kaye believes mandatory health checks for passengers, increased levels of hygiene and compulsory face masks would be more realistic options to enable airports to reopen and air travel to resume. 
JACKSON, Miss. – Money meant to help poor residents was used to buy luxury cars, sponsor a college baseball tournament and hire family members of a top state official, according to a report from State Auditor Shad White.The 104-page audit of the Mississippi Department of Human Services released Monday shows how federal welfare grant funds flowed from DHS into two nonprofit groups, which allegedly spent the cash in inappropriate or questionable ways. More than $94 million in welfare money spending was "questioned" by auditors, according to the report – alleging either outright misspending or lack of documentation showing it was spent properly. In a statement, White said the report "shows the most egregious misspending my staff have seen in their careers at the Office of the State Auditor." He said, "If there was a way to misspend money, it seems DHS leadership or their grantees thought of it and tried it."USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll: Americans overwhelmingly support vote-by-mail push, but Republicans more warySecretary of Senate: Biden records can't be disclosedThe routine annual audit, which focused on fiscal year 2019, follows criminal indictments this year related to the welfare spending. White called that case Mississippi's largest embezzlement scandal, involving about $4 million in welfare money known as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or TANF. Those facing criminal charges include former Department of Human Services Director John Davis, as well as Nancy New, the leader of the Mississippi Community Education Center, or MCEC, one of the nonprofit groups that received millions of TANF dollars. The USA TODAY Network's Mississippi Clarion Ledger and other outlets reported on issues at the state's human services department and potential misspending by MCEC for months. The extent of misspending and lack of controls detailed in Monday's audit was not previously known. The audit shows for the first time how a second nonprofit group, the Family Resource Center of North Mississippi, or FRC, allegedly made many questionable or inappropriate expenditures using welfare cash. According to the audit, the spending was possible because Davis limited outside monitoring of the welfare grants. Auditors said they found forged documents, a limited or nonexistent process for vetting contracts, fraudulent accounting and more.White said his office will forward the findings to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the welfare program. Depending on what the feds view as misspending, White said, this could lead to cuts in TANF allotments or other sanctions placed on the state. Among the audit's "questioned" spending:The two nonprofit groups used welfare money to hire lobbyists, often without paperwork describing the work they were supposed to do.MCEC gave contracts to, and hired, family members of Davis, sometimes making lump sum payments. The payments and salaries to his nephew and brother-in-law totaled more than $1 million over the past several years, auditors said. Both nonprofit groups gave welfare money to a trio of wrestlers, Ted DiBiase, Ted DiBiase, Jr. and Brett DiBiase – some of it for work never performed, some for "unreasonable" travel costs. MCEC paid Victory Sports Foundation with welfare money to run fitness programs, some of which Mississippi legislators and other officials or staffers participated in, free of charge. The trainer who runs Victory, said he did not know he received welfare money. MCEC bought three cars with welfare money, each worth more than $50,000, for New and two sons. Salaries, cellphones and other expenses were paid using welfare money. The vehicles included a 2018 Nissan Armada, a Chevrolet Silverado and a Ford F-250. In each case, the vehicle was registered to MCEC, but in each case, auditors said the vehicles were for personal use. MCEC used welfare money for sports-related purposes, including sponsoring a college baseball tournament and other NCAA events. MCEC cut a $3,000 check to a bookkeeper of MCEC, though a handwritten note says "$3,000 cash was given to" Davis, the DHS executive director. MCEC moved $6 million to a private school and organization run by New and bought supplies for the school. DHS officials were scheduled to respond to the report Monday afternoon at a news conference. The directors of MCEC and FRC did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. Neither did attorneys for New and Davis. White said additional indictments could come in the separate criminal case. Federal investigators, including the FBI, are involved. “This audit should be a wake-up call to everyone in government," White said. "The old way of doing things, where you do whatever your boss or a person who controls a lot of money tells you to do, or you ignore the law around how to spend money because you think no one is looking – those days are over."

Don't miss this month's supermoon — it's the last one of the year. May's "Flower Moon" will peak early Thursday morning, but will appear full for much of the week.The final supermoon of 2020 will reach its peak at 6:45 a.m. ET on Thursday, giving early risers the absolute best view, according to NASA. The moon will appear full from Tuesday night until Friday morning, so there will be plenty of opportunities to catch a glimpse.The full moon in May was called the "Flower Moon" by some Native American tribes for the large number of flowers that bloom this month, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac. It is also sometimes referred to as the Corn Planting Moon and Milk Moon, according to NASA.This year's May full moon is also called the Vesak Festival Moon, NASA says, as it corresponds to the Buddhist holiday Vesak — which honors the birth, enlightenment and passing of Gautama Buddha. The "Flower Moon" is the last in a series of four supermoons in quick succession this year. The others occurred in February, March and April. A supermoon happens when a moon is both full and closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit at the same time, according to NASA. This phenomenon makes the full moon appear "slightly" brighter and larger than normal, according to the agency.The year's final supermoon isn't the only thing to keep a lookout for in the skies this month. The Eta Aquarids meteor shower  is expected to peak early Tuesday morning — Cinco de Mayo. The show will be visible in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the best views just before dawn. It's advised to stargaze in an open area without light pollution to obstruct nature's main event. However, as the shower is peaking close to the full moon, only the brightest of shooting stars will be seen by onlookers.  
UNITED NATIONS, June 13 (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly condemned attacks on two oil tankers on Thursday in the Gulf of Oman that left one ablaze and both adrift, warning that the world cannot afford “a major confrontation in the Gulf region.”“I strongly condemn any attack against civilian vessels. Facts must be established and responsibilities clarified,” he told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on cooperation between the United Nations and the League of Arab States.
1. Dow set to add to two-session rally of nearly 1,100 pointsDow futures were pointing to an over 250-point gain at Thursday’s open after weekly government data pushed coronavirus-driven jobless claims to over 40 million. First-time filings for unemployment benefits last week came in a bit higher-than-expected at 2.12 million, a terrible level but a continuation of the slowing pace of new claims.The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday jumped 553 points, or 2.2%, closing above 25,000 for the first time since March. Coupled with Tuesday’s nearly 530 point advance, the Dow has soared nearly 1,100 points, or 4.4%, in the past two sessions as Wall Street grows more optimistic about the economy even as the Covid-19 death toll in the U.S. exceeded 100,000 on Wednesday.In addition to the Labor Department’s weekly look at jobless claims Thursday, the Commerce Department issued April durable goods and its second reading on first-quarter economic growth. Durable goods orders last month fell 17.2%, slightly higher than expectations. GDP in the first three months of the year, before the full brunt of state lockdowns, showed a greater-than-expected contraction of 5% compared to the 4.8% first-reading decline.2. U.S. and Chinese relations strain on numerous frontsChina’s parliament Thursday approved a proposal to impose a new national security law for Hong Kong, and paving the way for the legislation to be finalized and implemented. Protests in the autonomous Chinese territory reignited after the legislation was first proposed Friday. The U.S. has criticized China’s move, saying it undermines Hong Kong’s freedoms that Beijing promised to keep in place for 50 years when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.In a separate issue that could further erode Washington and Beijing relations, already strained over the origins of the coronavirus outbreak, the House sent President Donald Trump a bill calling for sanctions against Chinese officials for the detention and torture of Uighur Muslims in the country’s western region of Xinjiang. The legislation was approved by 413-1 after passing overwhelmingly in the Senate earlier this month. Trump has not said whether he intends to sign it into law.3. As Trump goes after social media, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg reactsTrump is expected to sign on Thursday an executive order targeting social media companies one day after threatening to shut down Twitter and other platforms that he accuses of stifling conservative voices. Trump’s latest dispute with social media emerged after Twitter on Tuesday for the first time attached a warning to some of his tweets prompting readers to fact check the president’s claims. In a CNBC interview that aired Thursday morning, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was asked about it. He said he does not think social networks should be fact-checking what politicians post.4. American Airlines plans to cut 5,000 management and support jobsAmerican Airlines plans to cut 30% of its management and support staff, a reduction of about 5,000 jobs, because of the toll coronavirus is taking on the business, according to a company memo that was viewed by CNBC. The airline also started offering buyouts to these employees and plans to offer voluntary leave and buyouts for front-line staff, such as flight attendants, in June. Last month, airlines started to receive parts of a $25 billion federal aid package set aside for the carriers. The airlines that accepted the aid are prohibited from laying off or cutting the pay rates of employees through Sept. 30.5. Boeing resumes production of still-grounded 737 MaxBoeing has resumed manufacturing its beleaguered 737 Max planes. Production was halted in January as a worldwide grounding of the planes dragged on longer than expected. Airlines have been prohibited from flying the 737 Max since March 2019 after the second of two fatal crashes involving the jet that killed a total of 346 people. Boeing halted deliveries shortly after the second crash. It has been logging a surge in cancellations from customers this year as the coronavirus pandemic adds to its struggles. Earlier Wednesday, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said the company is laying off close to 7,000 employees this week, the first group in a plan to reduce its staff of 160,000 by 10%.
Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump on Thursday again publicly mocked teen climate crisis activist Greta Thunberg, tweeting that the 16-year-old Swede who has inspired protesters worldwide has "anger management" issues.Thunberg, who was named Time magazine's Person of the Year earlier this week over Trump, has sternly castigated world leaders for not doing enough to combat the climate crisis, and memorably stared down Trump at the UN General Assembly in September. She has been open about her diagnosis of Asperger's, calling it a "superpower" that helps her activism."So ridiculous. Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!" Trump wrote Thursday morning, responding to a tweet congratulating Thunberg on being named Person of the Year.Trump frequently attacks and mocks political enemies on Twitter, and previously went after Thunberg in September, though his Thursday morning broadside was still jarring coming from a sitting US president against a teenager.Following the President's tweet, Thunberg updated her Twitter bio to reflect Trump's comments: "A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend."In September, following her excoriation of world leaders at the UN, Trump tweeted of Thunberg: "She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!"At the time, Thunberg also updated her Twitter bio to refer to herself using Trump's words.Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential frontrunner who has often taken Trump to task for his behavior, chastised the President for his tweet."What kind of president bullies a teenager? @realDonaldTrump, you could learn a few things from Greta on what it means to be a leader," Biden said on Twitter.Time magazine announced Wednesday that it had chosen Thunberg as its Person of the Year, making her the youngest individual to be recognized."Thunberg has become the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet—and the avatar of a broader generational shift in our culture that is playing out everywhere from the campuses of Hong Kong to the halls of Congress in Washington," Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote.Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry and Hong Kong protesters were on the shortlist for who has been the most influential this year. Trump deeply covets being Person of the Year: he thanked Time when he was chosen in 2016 and lashed out at the magazine a year later when he was passed over.
WASHINGTON — Critics of President Trump cheered on Monday when a federal judge ruled that the former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II must testify to Congress — and scathingly labeled “fiction” the administration’s arguments that top White House aides are immune from congressional subpoenas.Indeed, the outcome was the latest in a string of lower-court losses for Mr. Trump as he defends his stonewalling of lawmakers’ oversight and the impeachment investigation. Other fights are playing out in the courts over Mr. Trump’s financial records and grand-jury evidence in the Russia investigation.But from a realist perspective, Mr. Trump is winning despite losing.That is because it is now late November — not May, when Mr. McGahn, on Mr. Trump’s directions, first defied the subpoena, or even August, when the House asked the judge, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to enforce its subpoena.The proceedings before Judge Jackson consumed nearly a third of the year as she took briefs, conducted oral arguments and then composed a 120-page opinion. And her ruling was merely the end of the first step.The Justice Department immediately filed an appeal and sought a stay — virtually ensuring that the fight over Mr. McGahn will remain bogged down for the foreseeable future. (On Wednesday, Judge Jackson placed a hold on her ruling to consider the stay motion.) And even if Mr. McGahn someday is forced to show up, a new cycle of litigation will inevitably start over whether specific information he might testify about is subject to executive privilege.Meanwhile, time is on Mr. Trump’s side. The realistic window for Congress to consider impeaching him is closing, with the 2020 election less than a year away. If the overriding goal is to keep information from coming out while his term and potential re-election hang in the balance, the Trump legal strategy is succeeding despite all the adverse rulings.“This is not about putting down markers for all time — it’s more about particular short-term objectives,” said Martin Lederman, a Georgetown law professor who worked on executive-power issues as a lawyer in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel.Like a football team up late in a game whose defense hangs back to prevent big plays while letting its opponent make shorter gains, Mr. Trump’s legal team is looking to run out the clock, putting forth aggressive legal theories often backed by scant precedent. The strategy risks periodic bad headlines in the short term and could lead to definitive rulings that hamstring future presidents — but it is demonstrably advantageous for consuming time.The theories include asserting that Congress lacks legitimate legislative authority to conduct oversight of whether government officials are engaged in wrongdoing, even though lawmakers have done so for generations; that impeachment investigators cannot gain access to grand-jury evidence, even though an appeals court permitted just that during Watergate; and that senior presidential aides are immune from subpoenas, even though a judge rejected that theory in 2008.House Democrats have turned to the courts at an unprecedented tempo in their clashes with Mr. Trump, and they went into court on Tuesday to file yet another case — this one challenging the administration’s defiance of a subpoena for documents about its attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. But they are also growing disillusioned with the courts as a solution.The Democrat leading the investigation into the Ukraine affair, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, has made clear that lawmakers will move forward with weighing articles of impeachment rather than getting bogged down in courts. He used another sports metaphor, the tactic of boxers who lean against the ring ropes and trick their opponents into exhausting themselves by ineffectively pummeling them.“We are not willing to go the months and months and months of rope-a-dope in the courts, which the administration would love to do,” Mr. Schiff said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, explaining that he and his colleagues view their investigation as urgent because Mr. Trump has solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. Because of that, Mr. Schiff said, they will not wait even for witness testimony and documents they would like to obtain.Indeed, in another major court development on Monday that got far less attention than the McGahn lawsuit, the Supreme Court blocked an appeals court ruling that the House can subpoena Mr. Trump’s financial records while the justices consider whether to hear the case — alongside a similar case involving the Manhattan district attorney’s push for such records.Both cases generated headlines when district court judges and then appeals courts ruled against the president. But if the Supreme Court does take the appeals, justices may issue no final judgment until the court’s term ends in seven months.Mr. Trump suggested he instead had a more principled motive than running out the clock on Tuesday, claiming in a series of tweets that he would be happy to let his current and former aides tell Congress what they know, and insisting that he is only blocking them from talking to ensure that “future Presidents should in no way be compromised.”“I am fighting for future Presidents and the Office of the President,” Mr. Trump said. “Other than that, I would actually like people to testify.”His claim that he is blocking aides from disclosing what they know because he wants to strengthen the institution of the presidency over the long term echoes justifications of other presidents in previous disputes, like the George W. Bush administration’s range of efforts to expand presidential power.The men who drove that Bush agenda — Vice President Dick Cheney and his top lawyer, David S. Addington, a key leader on the administration legal team — held longstanding ideological views about executive power, said Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard professor who led the Office of Legal Counsel in the Bush administration.But “that is not true of Trump, I don’t think,” Mr. Goldsmith said, noting that Attorney General William P. Barr, who believes in stronger executive power as a lifelong principle, is an exception. Instead, the Trump administration’s legal positions “seem like short-term tactical moves,” Mr. Goldsmith said.Much of the line where Congress’s power stops and the president’s begins is blurry, with few definitive precedents. That ambiguity gives presidents freedom to maneuver. But, Mr. Goldsmith warned, if an aggressive president pushes an extreme theory all the way to the Supreme Court, it can risk a definitive ruling tying future presidents’ hands.The danger for the institution of the presidency, Mr. Goldsmith said, is that “really aggressive assertions of executive power often end up creating bad executive power precedents.”To be sure, Mr. Trump may also be hoping that the Supreme Court — with its majority of five justices appointed by Republicans now including two by him — could eventually rule for him, just as it ultimately voted, 5 to 4, to permit a watered-down version of his travel ban even though lower courts had blocked it.Many administrations have sometimes made privilege and immunity claims to fend off or delay congressional attempts to pry information out of the executive branch, Mr. Lederman noted. But prior presidents, unlike Mr. Trump, were willing to resolve disputes through negotiation and compromise long before they could reach the Supreme Court.“If the Supreme Court justices decide they want to drag these disputes out, they can,” Mr. Lederman said.  
Jeff Bezos -founded Blue Origin  has recorded another successful mission for its New Shepard sub-orbital launch vehicle, which is a key step as it readies the spacecraft for human spaceflight. This is also the sixth flight of this re-used booster, which is a record for Blue Origin in terms of relying on and recovering one of its rocket stages.This is the ninth time that Blue Origin has flown commercial payloads aboard New Shepard, and each launch moves it one step closer to demonstrating the system’s readiness for carrying crew on board. This launch carried experimental payloads that will be used for research, including materials used in student studies. It also had thousands of postcards on board written by students from around the world, which were submitted to the Club for the Future nonprofit set up by Blue Origin earlier this year to provide educational resources about space to schools and students.Blue Origin intends to fly paying space tourists aboard New Shepard eventually, along with other commercial astronauts making the trip for research and other missions. Up to six passengers can fit in Blue Origin’s capsule atop the New Shepard, but we don’t yet know when it’ll actually be carrying anyone on board, either for testing or for commercial flights.
US President Donald Trump on Tuesday shared a bizarre theory that liberals were trying to rename Thanksgiving."You know, some people want to change the name Thanksgiving," Trump claimed during a wild rally in Sunrise, Florida.Without giving any further details, he said: "They don't want to use the term 'Thanksgiving.'"He told his supporters "we're not changing it," adding, "We're going to have do little work on Thanksgiving.""People have different ideas why it shouldn't be called Thanksgiving," he said. "But everybody in this room, I know, loves the name Thanksgiving, and we're not changing it."You can watch the moment here:There is no evidence that people are trying to rename the holiday, and Trump did not say what people want to rename it to.Trump drew parallels with his past criticism of the phrase "Happy holidays," which he repeatedly decried during his 2016 presidential campaign."And that was true also with Christmas, but now everybody's using Christmas again," he said."Remember I said that?"Trump had previously attacked a so-called "war on Christmas," saying during his presidential campaign: "If I become president, we're going to be saying 'Merry Christmas' at every store."Trump then declared victory in a 2017 speech, claiming: "We can say 'Merry Christmas' again."Despite Trump's protestations, most Americans don't seem to mind saying or hearing the more neutral "Happy holidays." A 2016 survey from Public Policy Polling found that more than 80% of Americans didn't care which phrase people used.Even Trump's hotels, restaurants, and shops, and well as his daughter Ivanka Trump, have all used the phrase "Happy holidays" during his presidency.
Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and South Carolina governor, wrote in an op-ed published Wednesday that today's "outrage culture" would not allow for the removal of the Confederate flag in her state. Her op-ed in The Washington Post comes after the swift backlash she faced over an interview she gave earlier this month, when she said that South Carolinians once equated the Confederate flag with "service and sacrifice and heritage" before the shooter in the 2015 deadly attack on a Charleston church "hijacked" it.Haley wrote on Wednesday that these comments are similar to ones she has made before, including in a speech calling for the flag's removal in 2015. At the time, she noted that the Confederate flag represented "a brutally oppressive past," but that others considered it to stand for "traditions of history, of heritage and of ancestry.""As a state, we can survive, as we have done, while still being home to both of those viewpoints," Haley said in 2015. "We do not need to declare a winner and loser.""Those words were well received by South Carolinians," she wrote in the op-ed. "They played a part in healing our state, and in bridging the decades-long political divide over the flag."Nikki Haley: Confederate flag was 'hijacked' after Charleston church shootingHaley said she is not sure South Carolina would be able to remove the flag today, not because of a rise in white nationalism that she called "disturbing," but because compromise is no longer valued, and "today’s media hysteria that makes it far more difficult to have the kind of thoughtful and prayerful dialogue we had following the Charleston murders.""Everyone knows the flag has always been a symbol of slavery, discrimination and hate for many people. But not everyone sees the flag that way," Haley wrote. She went on to say she "will never understand" those who use the flag as a symbol of their white supremacy."But there’s also another group of people. It’s a group that today’s outrage culture wants to either deny exists or to condemn in the harshest terms. These are people who do not see the Confederate battle flag in racial terms. While I don’t agree with their view of the flag, I respect them," Haley said.She wrote that when she met privately with Republicans in South Carolina to urge them to vote for the flag's removal in 2015, she was able to reach a middle ground."I made the case that no child should feel unwelcomed at our state capitol because the Confederate battle flag was flying there," Haley wrote. "...Today’s outrage culture would instead have made the case that everyone who respects the Confederate flag is an evil racist."USA TODAY interview: Nikki Haley isn't running for president. That is, not yet.After her comments earlier in the month, many on social media expressed dismay at her view of the flag.State Representative JA Moore, who lost his sister in the shooting, tweeted, "Let’s be clear @NikkiHaley continued use of this tragedy for political reasons is disgusting.” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, tweeted: "Really, Nikki?! The Confederate Flag represented 'service, sacrifice and heritage'? To whom? The black people who were terrorized & lynched in its name? You said it should never have been there. Roof didn’t hijack the meaning of that flag, he inherited it."
LONDON — Britain’s Conservative Party and Prime Minister Boris Johnson secured a majority in Parliament on Friday, winning an election that pitted Johnson's plan to "get Brexit done" against opposition parties who wanted to delay Britain's departure from the European Union or even cancel it altogether.The victory makes Johnson the most electorally successful Conservative leader since Margaret Thatcher and is a disaster for left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who was already facing calls for his resignation.The result likely paves the way forJohnson to push through Brexit on Jan. 31 after three years of divisive and acrimonious debate by lawmakers over whether Britain should leave a bloc it joined more than four decades ago.While results were still rolling in, the Conservatives had claimed 326 of 650 seats in the House of Commons and appeared headed to the party's best election performance since 1987.U.S. President Donald Trump took notice."Congratulations to Boris Johnson on his great WIN!," Trump tweeted early Friday. "Britain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT. This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the E.U. Celebrate Boris!"The Labour Party was forecast to win fewer than 200 seats, its worst showing in decades. Exit polls in the past few British elections have been accurate. The vote was Britain's first winter general election for nearly a century and its fourth national ballot in less than five years. Though it was not formally directly connected to Brexit, Johnson called the vote two years ahead of time in an attempt to gain a working majority to break a parliamentary deadlock over the nation's EU exit.The results showed that three years after Britain narrowly voted to leave the EU, the nation is as divided over Brexit as it was in 2016.Conservatives made gains in traditional Labour strongholds in northern England. In Scotland, the pro-EU Scottish National Party was forecast to make gains. "We're fed up. This just needs to be over," said Julie Ames, 30, who works in a hair salon, as she made her way to a voting station south of Britain's capital Thursday.  British electoral law prohibits revealing details about how another person has voted. Posts on social media indicated long lines at some voting stations, which is unusual in Britain. It could suggest that turnout was higher than anticipated.The vote comes amid allegations of disinformation campaigns and falsehoods disseminated by the main political parties. Johnson's Conservative Party has done more than any other group to stretch the limits of truth and transparency, according to a study by First Draft, a media watchdog. It found that nearly 90% of Facebook ads paid for by the Conservatives in the first few days of December contained misleading claims.Over the period, the Conservative Party created more than 6,000 ads. Corbyn, 70, had put the preservation of Britain's cherished state-funded National Health Service (HNS) at the center of his campaign. The Labour Party argued that Brexit would cause the NHS to be opened up to U.S. pharmaceutical and technology firms as part of Johnson's drive to create a lower-taxed, more lightly regulated post-Brexit Britain. Johnson has repeatedly disputed that claim, though he had a record of being pro-big business and pro-development when he was London's mayor from 2008-2016. "Standing behind the NHS is a kind of secular religion for all Britons," said Richard Whitman, a political scientist at the University of Kent. Whitman said the election was a choice between retaining close economic and political ties with Europe or moving closer to the United States as a consequence of an expected trade deal the two nations would sign after Brexit.   A U.S. tilt seems inevitable, he said. Johnson's close relationship with President Donald Trump remains undisturbed.The British pound surged more than 2% against the U.S. dollar as the exit poll was unveiled. Johnson focused almost exclusively on Brexit throughout his campaign."If we can get a working majority, we have a deal, it's ready to go," Johnson said before the vote during his final campaign appearance in central England."We put it in, slam it in the oven, take it out, and there it is – get Brexit done," the prime minister said as he watched pies being baked at a catering company. Corbyn said at his final campaign rally this week, "My message to all those voters who are still undecided is that you can vote for hope in this election."Though that hope ran out Thursday, Brexit will be far from complete Feb. 1.Even if Johnson succeeds in formally dragging Britain out of the alliance, it will be just the start of a deeper EU separation process likely to include tense negotiations over trade, borders, agriculture, security and other issues that could last several years.On Twitter, Jess Phillips, a Labour Party politician who represents a constituency in Birmingham in central England, said, "There are very few words for how heartbroken I am for the community I represent."The outcome of Thursday's vote could have major consequences for the United Kingdom's union of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU in 2016, and political leaders there threatened to call an independence vote if Brexit takes place.    "The Brexit battle is over. Britain will now formally leave the European Union. And the European Union will contract for the first time. 'Remain' will have to transform to 'Rejoin.' And that will be a much harder, longer and perhaps generational struggle," said Matthew Goodwin, a political expert at Chatham House, a think tank. 
President Trump twice received intelligence briefings on the coronavirus in January, according to a White House official. The official tells NPR the briefings occurred on Jan. 23 and Jan. 28.    "The president was told that the coronavirus was potentially going to 'spread globally,' " the official said of the first briefing, which came two days after the first case of the virus was reported in the United States. "But the 'good news' was that it was not deadly for most people," the official said the president was told.    Five days after that initial briefing, the president was briefed again, according to the official. This time, he was told the virus "was spreading outside of China, but that deaths from the disease were happening only in China," the official said. "He was also told that China was withholding data."   The question of what Trump knew about the coronavirus, when he was aware of it and the tenor of those conversations have come under heavy scrutiny, as the administration faces criticism that it was slow to respond to early warnings about the virus. In the time since the president's January briefings, the U.S. has reported more than 1.1 million cases of the coronavirus — more than any other nation. In all, more than 66,000 Americans have died.               The president has defended his handling of the crisis — pointing to steps like his decision at the end of January to restrict travel into the U.S. from China. But for much of the following month, the president and some of his top surrogates downplayed the threat of the virus.   "We pretty much shut it down coming in from China," the president said in an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News early in February. By the end of the month, with the virus reported in several dozen countries at that point, he continued to tell reporters that the risk "remains very low."   During his State of the Union address, roughly a week after being told that China was withholding data, Trump said his administration was "coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak."   To this point, the White House has offered little clarity publicly about the exact dates when Trump was briefed about the virus. Asked about this on Thursday, Trump told reporters that he spoke with intelligence officials about the coronavirus "in January, later January," adding that intelligence officials had confirmed that this was the case.    On Monday, when The Washington Post reported that Trump received more than a dozen classified briefings in January and February, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence responded, "The detail of this is not true," and declined to elaborate.
Troubled Scott Disick has checked himself into a luxury addiction treatment center in The Rocky Mountains after relapsing with booze and drugs, DailyMailTV can exclusively reveal.The reality star arrived at the exclusive All Points North Lodge in Edwards, Colorado last Tuesday.Sources say Disick, known for his hard partying and multiple stints in rehab, has been drinking heavily and taking cocaine while in coronavirus lockdown.It's understood the 36-year-old has struggled with family life during lockdown and is still having a hard time coping with the loss of both his parents a few years ago.After arriving at the brand new resort-style mountain retreat, which opened its doors in March, Disick was placed under immediate COVID-19 quarantine and confined to his private suite.The star was tested for coronavirus and once given the all clear, was allowed to join other patients at the facility Friday.A source told DailyMailTV: 'Scott flew in on Tuesday and had to Zoom in to a group meeting from his room to introduce himself.'He said he's having trauma from his past, he mentioned trouble with his ex and said he's also having trouble with his children and he's been taking cocaine and drinking a lot.'He looked pretty skinny and told the group he was coming to rehab to work on his issues and said he was having withdrawal symptoms and was tired and lethargic.'He told staff he didn't want any special treatment during his stay, in terms of meals and therapy.' Disick has long had issues with alcoholism and drug use to combat his personal problems.And on last Thursday's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the reality star confessed that he still struggles to deal with losing both his parents within three months of each other - especially now that his kids have begun to ask about them.His mom Bonnie passed away in 2013 after a long illness, while his father Jeff died of unknown causes in 2014 and only child Disick was extremely close to them.And Disick, who shares three children with ex Kourtney Kardashian, 41, revealed that he has been going through a few personal struggles.He and Kourtney were together on and off for 12 years, and share children Mason, 10, and Penelope, seven, and Reign, five together. He said on the show: 'Losing my parents is not an easy subject for me to talk about, It puts me in a very vulnerable place, to remember them and think about them.'In the past Disick has yo-yoed in and out of rehab as he battled to overcome his demons.His troubles with alcohol and drugs reached an all-time high in 2014 when he downed a bottle of sleeping pills.He immediately made an attempt at recovery at a rehab facility in Connecticut.But just when it seemed that he might finally leave his hard-partying ways behind, he checked out early.In July, 2015 Disick and Kourtney split for good when pictures surfaced of him getting cozy with his ex-girlfriend Chloe Bartoli in Monte Carlo and the star began to unravel once again.In October 2015, he checked into a facility in Malibu for drug and alcohol abuse, after previously seeking treatment in Costa Rica and Florida.And in early 2016, after another bender of cocaine, vodka, beer and Viagra, Disick was reportedly discovered unresponsive in bed at his Los Angeles home.In August, 2017 after months of hard partying, womanizing and bizarre behavior, Disick was hospitalized yet again near his home in the exclusive Hidden Hills gated community near Calabasas.In September 2017 Disick met current girlfriend Sofia Richie, Lionel Richie's daughter, and seemed to clean up his act.Now family and friends hope the troubled star can get himself cleaned up once and for all at the 72-room luxury wellness retreat, which is a former five star hotel nestled in the heart of The Rocky Mountains.The 77,000-square-foot lodge stands at the top of a ridge and has the look of a majestic European castle, boasting sweeping views across the Eagle Valley.Interestingly, the property, formerly the Cordillera Lodge & Spa, became infamous in 2003 when a 19-year-old concierge accused basketball superstar Kobe Bryant of sexual assault at the resort.The hotel was bought by Malibu-based APN Capital in 2016 and founder Noah Nordheimer is overseeing a $136 million investment in the high-end project.The property was given a $20 million makeover and with a price point of between $40,000 to $120,000 a month, it caters for celebrities, musicians, high net worth individuals and top athletes.According to the website, the facility helps 'clients struggling with addiction, mental health challenges, trauma, and major life decisions to better understand and manage their lives.'The state-of-the-art center has outdoor and indoor swimming pools and hot tubs, hyperbaric chambers, a float tank, high end gym and spa, and offers massages, acupuncture, yoga, boxing and an art therapy room.It also offers a slew of outdoor activities including hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, white water rafting, camping and skiing and snowboarding in the winter.A world-class team of medical professionals, mental health clinicians, nutritionists, and fitness trainers help patients through specially customized programs.Programs take a minimum of one month with some patients staying three months and longer.The one-of-a-kind addiction treatment program uses science-based intervention with health, fitness, medicine and psychiatry, instead of the traditional 12-step approach.The source added: 'It's a pretty nice high end place and the team is filled with experts from Florida.'It's not as restrictive as some places, you can use your phone for an hour during lunch and two hours in the evening and you get intense therapy, they're big on group therapy.' 
Olivia Newton-John, who is dealing with cancer for the third time, says she's leaning on cannabis. "I use a lot of cannabis in my healing," she told Yahoo Lifestyle in an interview that published Thursday."It helped me incredibly with pain and sleep,” Newton-John, 70, said. The "Don't Stop Believin' " author told People magazine in an interview that published last month, that her husband, businessman John Easterling, grows cannabis on the grounds of their So-Cal ranch. "He grows the plants and makes them into liquid for me," she told People. "I take drops maybe four to five times a day.”Newton-John also opened up to Yahoo about the beginning of her cancer battle. “The first time I was diagnosed with breast cancer, it was 1992,” she told the outlet. “I found a lump in my breast, (but) my mammogram was negative. I had a feeling … and we found out the cancer was hiding. So I always tell women even if they tell you they don’t see anything, trust how you feel. Trust your instincts.”More: Olivia Newton-John is facing third cancer battle with 'bravery,' new Lifetime movies sayNewton-John, who shared with Yahoo she is an advocate of "a positive attitude," decided she would survive. "I had to make a decision that no matter what, I was going to be OK," she said. "My main decision was, I’m going to get better, and I have a young child (daughter Chloe Rose Lattanzi, now 33) to raise."Newton-John announced in 2018 a tumor had returned to her back. She also recently revealed a second bout of cancer that surfaced in her shoulder in 2013, which she revealed on "Today" in March had previously been kept a secret "because of the speculation, which happened at times."Last month, Newton-John shared that she had contacted "Jeopardy!" host Alex Trebek after learning of his diagnosis with stage 4 pancreatic cancer."I sent him a message saying, 'I know you can get through this,' and, 'Don't listen to stage 4 and all of (that)," she told Entertainment Tonight. "Don't read the statistics and stay focused and see how you can heal yourself. That helps."She continued: "Sense of humor is vital.

Dr. Anthony Stephen Fauci didn’t grow up wanting to be famous. Mostly he just wanted to make a difference. But now a lifetime of service has flicked on a searing spotlight.Perhaps not since the late actor Jack Palance did one-armed push-ups at the 1991 Oscars at age 73 – YouTube it, millennials – has the nation been this seduced by a senior citizen. By virtue of his calm, Brooklyn-inflected White House briefings on the coronavirus pandemic that frequently if diplomatically contradict statements by President Donald Trump, Fauci, 79, has become a meme, spawned fan clubs and been lovingly parodied by Brad Pitt.Fauci’s longtime official title is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a part of the National Institutes of Health. But since becoming the face of the country's COVID-19 pandemic, the career immunologist who has battled everything from AIDS to Ebola is increasingly referred to as America’s Doctor.And he's in the headlines again this week, having been barred by the White House from addressing House lawmakers Wednesday on the topic of the administration's response to the crisis. Instead, Fauci will meet with a GOP-led subcommittee on May 12.So just who is Tony Fauci?Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House.Alex Brandon, AP ImagesInterviews with friends and colleagues offer overlapping descriptions of a man as dedicated to hard work – endless hours peppered with power walks – as he is to his wife, scientist Christine Grady, and three accomplished daughters.They describe a man who takes as much pride in his Bolognese pasta sauce (the key, one friend says, is the long simmering time) as he does in enduring relationships. He's a burger-and-beer-at-the-bar guy, but he's also a public servant built for our trying times.“Tony’s capable of elevating his game to whatever is needed, and more has been demanded of him now than in any time in his career,” says Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. “In the eyes of the American public, he’s the voice we need right now, one of credibility.”Steven Gabbe met Fauci when both were at Cornell Medical College in New York City in the late 1960s, and “the person you see now on TV is the same guy I met back then, smart and humble.”Gabbe, emeritus CEO of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, lauds his friend’s sense of humor. "I’m sure he finds it entertaining that there are bobblehead dolls of him now," he says. "But he’s so grounded I don’t think it would go to his head.”Fauci would be excused it if did. In a recent survey of 1,900 registered U.S. voters, Morning Consult asked respondents whom they would trust "a lot" or "some" to end social distancing. Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention topped the list among all voters with 71% trust ratings.Three months in: A timeline of how COVID-19 has unfolded in the USSuch a high-profile status inevitably also has generated criticism.Right-wing pundits have assailed how shelter-in-place guidelines he supported have affected the economy, leading conservative internet TV host Bill Mitchell to tweet “this Dr. Doom Fauci is the most depressing idiot I’ve ever listened to.”That harsh assessment has some grounding in a real issue, says Jonathan Engel, professor at the Marxe School of Public and International Affairs at Baruch College, part of the City University of New York system.“Cost-benefit analysis is not the way Fauci thinks. He’s a physician and immunologist,”  Engel says. “So that’s where the frustration in some red states comes from. You’re saving lives, but you’re also destroying lives. Someone else needs to be there to step back and think about the whole picture, but that’s not Fauci’s role.”Get daily coronavirus updates in your inbox: Sign up for our newsletter now.Critics ask: Did Fauci 'miss it'?Even some fellow scientists who praise Fauci’s professional accomplishments suggest not only that he was late sounding the alarm, but that having one celebrated virus point person is dangerous.“In January, February and part of March there was one physician on show after show, him, and while he’s great at explaining things in terms of telling the country to get prepared, he missed it,” says Marty Makary, professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “My concern is not with Anthony Fauci as much as it is in a media and policy world that puts its faith in one person.”USA TODAY NetworkDave GranlundIf anything, Fauci’s rise highlights the fact that no one person regardless of their stature – his laurels include almost every scientific accolade short of a Nobel Prize – should hold all the reins when it comes to national and global pandemics.“Tony’s taken on this big role in part because of the vacuum that exists,” says David Relman, a Fauci friend and professor of medicine at Stanford University.“But what if the next pandemic destroys our food? Or a bioterror attack?” he says. “We need a new leadership system that sits inside the White House, where people have the authority to tell the attorney general what to do, or the Federal Reserve or the secretary of defense, so you can move fast. Tony can’t do that. No one can. The system needs to change.”Fauci’s national stature indeed appears unique in U.S. history, says historian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University in Houston, citing past examples that fall short.In the late 1700s, a yellow fever outbreak in Philadelphia caused President George Washington to flee the city, leaving in charge the preeminent doctor and fellow Founding Father, Benjamin Rush.When President Woodrow Wilson got sick while visiting Paris during World War I, many scholars believe his physician and his wife were running the country for a spell.“So you have moments when doctors have become the voice of the country, but nothing like this,” Brinkley says. “The straight-talking Fauci is what you want to hear, much like if you go to a doctor you don’t want spin or blarney.”A Washington, D.C., bar joined forces with a real estate company to make these Fauci Pouchy cocktails, the proceeds of which go to a local food bank. The drinks are just another marker of Anthony Fauci's pop culture stardom as he continues to guide the nation through the coronavirus crisis.Courtesy of Regan PuryearBrinkley says that after the coronavirus pandemic starts to recede, Fauci is likely to go down in history “as one of few scientists who are now household names.”Some suggest Fauci enjoys this new spotlight too much. Although an NIAID press officer said Fauci was too busy for an interview, the doctor's media appearances are frequent and varied, from network news and comedy shows to online interviews with sports icons such as basketball star Steph Curry.Fauci Pouchys and 'Docta Fauci'And yet the public can’t seem to get enough. The Anthony Fauci Fan Club on Twitter has 24,000 followers and a pinned tweet that reads: “If you don’t have a crush on this man, do you even care about public health?”New York-based singer Missy Modell rewrote the lyrics to Lady Gaga’s 2008 hit “Paparazzi” to rhyme with “Docta Fauci.” Her Instagram hit includes the line “Tony, there’s no other superstar except for Andy,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Fauci’s likeness is splashed on coffee mugs, T-shirts and even donuts. In Washington, D.C., the town Fauci calls home, Capo’s Speakeasy teamed up with a real estate company to sell Fauci Pouchy to-go drinks, cocktails in see-through sealed bags emblazoned with the doctor's image.At Chef Geoff’s in northwest D.C., Fauci and his wife, a nurse bioethicist at the NIH, are regulars who in pre-virus times would pull up bar stools and order Chef Geoff Burgers and beers, says owner Geoff Tracy. He posted a sign warning takeout customers, “Dr. Antony Fauci is a long time guest and he wants SIX FEET.”“He’s a genuinely nice human being, and I deal with a lot who aren’t sometimes,” says Tracy, whose wife, CBS anchor Norah O’Donnell, has interviewed Fauci over the years. Tracy says Fauci’s ascent into the pop culture firmament doesn’t surprise him. But he doubts it fazes Fauci.Geoff Tracy, who runs Chef Geoff's in Washington, D.C., stands next to a sign inspired by a frequent diner, Anthony Fauci. Tracy says Fauci and his wife Christine are "burger and beer" type patrons, and have stopped by on occasion for take-out during the pandemic.Courtesy of Regan Puryear“My father-in-law is an infectious disease doctor, and these guys are not about picking fights or the limelight,” Tracy says. “They’re about sharing information and guiding you. And no one’s better at that than Tony.”Fauci recently told an interviewer he appreciated the way “classy” actor Brad Pitt played him on a recent "Saturday Night Live" stay-at-home broadcast, this after Fauci said in an interview that Pitt would be his top choice for someone to impersonate him on the show. But friends note celebrities don't fluster him.Stanford professor Relman, who focuses on microbiology and immunology, recalls talking to Fauci about the time U2 singer Bono, who has focused his philanthropy on Africa, wanted to discuss disease issues with Fauci.“Tony thought it would cause too big a scene at the NIH, so he just told Bono to come over to his house,” Relman says. “Bono did, but Tony forgot that that might completely freak out his daughters, which it did. Those are just his circles. His ability to talk honestly about important matters causes people to seek him out.”Study: Americans trust Fauci more than Trump or their own governorsFauci's hoop dreams dashed by heightFauci grew up in Brooklyn the grandson of Italian immigrants. His parents ran a pharmacy. He did deliveries on his bicycle, while his older sister Denise ran the register.In past interviews, Fauci hasn’t revealed much about his hardworking upbringing except to say that it laid the foundation for a life ultimately devoted to science and public service.Fauci went to Regis High School in Manhattan, which required commuting for hours on buses and subways. Although a standout basketball player, his height, 5-foot-7, prompted him to look for a career outside sports.For college, he attended Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, which like Regis was run by Jesuits, whose educational philosophy seeks to meld spirituality – Fauci is a lifelong Catholic – with social justice.Director of the National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health Anthony Fauci and his wife Christine Grady arrive at the White House for a state dinner October 18, 2016 in Washington, DC.

(“He’ll call me days before to make sure I’m still coming,” he says with a laugh.)“Tony was deeply affected by exposure to the Jesuit order, which fostered in him a self-expectation of service,” Goosby says. “This guy goes to sleep and wakes up asking, 'Have I done everything I can do?' It’s in his DNA.”As is a fierce work ethic. In summers during college, Fauci worked construction. As the story goes, one job found him helping on a new building at the Cornell Medical College. Fauci vowed one day he would be an alum, and he made it happen.“That story says it all to me,” says his friend Gabbe. “He just has this powerful drive that won’t be stopped. The same thing happened when he graduated and told people he was going to the NIH to study infectious diseases. People told him they were all conquered, this was a career-killer move. Not long after, AIDS hit.”Fauci’s role in the AIDS epidemic changed him. At first, he tackled the growing crisis with a measured, data-driven approach to trying to find a treatment. But that methodical tack infuriated gay activists watching friends die daily.“Initially, Fauci was very rigid in his approach to AIDS, and people like (gay rights activist and playwright) Larry Kramer got in his face, calling him the worst things,” says Baruch College professor Engel, who wrote “The Epidemic: A Global History of AIDS.” “And to Fauci’s credit, he got it and he changed.”Fauci had been seen as the detached scientific face of an uncaring administration led by President Ronald Reagan, late to understanding the scope of the AIDS crisis. Fauci started to meet with members of the gay rights community and quickly understood the need to include those who were suffering in finding a solution.Nina Pham is hugged by Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, outside of National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., on Friday. Pham, the first nurse diagnosed with Ebola after treating an infected man at a Dallas hospital, is free of the virus.Pablo Martinez Monsivais, APGoosby, who was running of one the nation’s first AIDS clinics in the late ‘80s, recalls attending a meeting with Fauci in Washington. The gathering was attacked by ACT UP activists, who locked the meeting’s attendees, there to discuss new drugs to fight HIV, inside the hall with chains.“A lot of us were nervous and scared of possible violence,” Goosby recalls. “But Tony looked at us and said: ‘This is our chance to learn about the frustrations of the community. It’s an opportunity for us to learn and serve.’ I’ll never forget that.”Fauci turned enemies into alliesThat shift in attitude – away from the rigidity of scientific pursuits and towards an embrace of the human reality – soon turned enemies into lifelong friends, says Matt Sharp, a San Francisco-based AIDS survivor and activist who was part of many ACT UP protests in the nation’s capital aimed at calling out Fauci.“What developed was a very interesting mutual respect, where you have a hero who once was an enemy,” Sharp says. “Once we got him to relate to us and our reality, trust was established. Today, the AIDS community is glad he’s the one leading this effort right now.”Over what is now nearly a 50-year career with the NIH, Fauci has worked for presidents as philosophically wide-ranging as Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, helping them through crises that included the post-9/11 anthrax scares, SARS in 2003, H1N1 in 2009 and Ebola in 2014.Those who know Fauci marvel at how he keeps his political leanings private.“I honestly don’t know if he’s a Democrat or Republican,” says Sharp. “But I know he’s got an amazing grace and an ability to cut through the (bull). That’s his genius.”That skill is particularly valuable now as Fauci continues to navigate his truth-telling role for a president whose response to criticism often is dismissal.  “He has always had a knack for telling it like it is, and letting the political chips fall where they may,” says Stanford’s Relman. “Don’t forget, Tony Fauci is a proud card-carrying New Yorker. He has a blunt, endearing and no-nonsense New York attitude, and I think Trump kind of gets that.”Brad Pitt as Dr. Anthony Fauci during the "Fauci Cold Open" on Saturday, April 25, 2020.NBCIndeed, a brief #FireFauci firestorm that flared in the wake of Fauci appearing to show exasperation at the president’s coronavirus remarks ended with Trump saying Fauci wasn’t going anywhere.That’s probably just fine with Fauci. He may not get much sleep these days, and he’s contending with political forces dueling over just how much reopening the country will lead to another coronavirus case spike and then more shutdowns.But friends insist he’d wouldn’t want to be anywhere other than in this hot seat. Says Osterholm of the University of Minnesota: "I would go so far as to say Tony's been the right man for the job for several decades now."The recipe for that success perhaps can be found in remarks Fauci made around this time in 2016 to the graduating class at Ohio State University.Fauci started out by telling the graduates – in his trademark Brooklyn patois that made “honor” sound like on-AH and “poverty” like PAW-vaty – that if they’re like him, they’ll soon forget every word their commencement speaker said.Then over the next 12 succinct minutes, Fauci laid out five credos to live by: Be a perpetual student, expect the unexpected, embrace public service, lead by example, and, finally, pursue happiness.As prescriptions go, Fauci has taken his own medicine. When he is at that West Wing lectern, he seems to radiate a sense of satisfaction at simply being of service despite the attendant slings and arrows of the post. “Different pursuits provide joy," Fauci urged the graduates. "Find your source of joy, and embrace it.”
As the stuntman Cliff Booth in Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” Brad Pitt laid down a performance of vintage Hollywood dudeness. His character is equally at ease being a human security blanket for his B-list-actor boss, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, as he is subduing murderous Manson family members while tripping on acid. In James Gray’s “Ad Astra,” Pitt used the same tools he wielded so deftly in Tarantino’s film — laconic cool; understated emotion — to build an entirely different version of masculinity. In it, he’s Roy McBride, an astronaut on an interplanetary mission to find his absentee (in multiple senses of the word) father. But McBride’s imperturbability is rooted in repression and hurt, nothing like Booth’s so-it-goes acceptance. “The two characters could be connected,” Pitt says, “in the sense that you have to go through an evolution to get to a place of comfort. You have to go through profound internal hardships.”There’s such stillness and ease to your work in “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” and “Ad Astra.” Those qualities weren’t always there earlier in your career. Is that because you’ve gotten better at picking roles? No, because I don’t know what the outcome of the work is going to be. But in the ’90s I did become aware that there was this kind of leading-man role that you could plug any of us into and it didn’t even matter. We would all have the same result. So as I’ve gotten older, I’ve become more conscious of thinking, If I am the one to play something, what can I bring that’s unique?What did you bring to Cliff Booth and Roy McBride? With Cliff it’s connected to my dad, the way he carries himself. It’s also the iconic figures like Butch and Sundance and in Clint Eastwood movies. Then it’s where I am in my life. I don’t care who you are, life is struggle. It’s how you perceive those struggles. As I’ve gotten older, I take them more as another day in the office, acceptance of what the day throws you. And in “Ad Astra,” we were looking at this idea of being older, being a dad. You become more aware of your shortcomings. You look into starting to break some of that open, which is not always comfortable. I said to James Gray: “I see this as very still, and I want to see how much truth and honesty can read on camera, can resonate.” It’s what they say: The camera doesn’t lie. Though I don’t know if that’s true. I’ve seen some people lie on camera, and it looks pretty good.Have you lied on camera? I must have somewhere. Some days you’re drowning on set. You just can’t quite get there.Was there a performance where you never got your head above water? My first 15 years of them.Those 15 years include films like “12 Monkeys.” You got an Oscar nomination for that one. I nailed the first half of “12 Monkeys.” I got the second half all wrong. That performance bothered me because there was a trap in the writing. It’s not the writing’s fault, but it was something that I couldn’t figure out. I knew in the second half of the film I was playing the gimmick of what was real in the first half — until the last scene — and it bugged the [expletive] out of me.Looking at the arc of your career, it seems as if a real shift happened somewhere around 2004. You started working more exclusively with higher-caliber directors. And maybe as a result, your acting had this new depth to it. I can see a line from then to now. Sorry, I realize that’s an observation and not a question. But you’re absolutely right. I’m happy someone could read that. It was really a turn on “Troy.” I was disappointed in it. When you’re trying to figure things out in your career, you get a lot of advice. People are telling you that you should be doing this, and other people are saying you should be doing that. There was this defining film I never got to do, a Coen brothers film called “To the White Sea.” We had an opportunity to go, and then it was shut down. Then another interesting opportunity arose, and instead I was talked into: “No, you need to be doing this other thing. You can get to your art project later.” I ended up taking that advice.And you made “Troy”? No, it wasn’t “Troy,” it was another thing. But that really made me think, I’m following my gut from here on out. I had to do “Troy” because — I guess I can say all this now — I pulled out of another movie and then had to do something for the studio. So I was put in “Troy.” It wasn’t painful, but I realized that the way that movie was being told was not how I wanted it to be. I made my own mistakes in it. What am I trying to say about “Troy”? I could not get out of the middle of the frame. It was driving me crazy. I’d become spoiled working with David Fincher. It’s no slight on Wolfgang Petersen. “Das Boot” is one of the all-time great films. But somewhere in it, “Troy” became a commercial kind of thing. Every shot was like, Here’s the hero! There was no mystery. So about that time I made a decision that I was only going to invest in quality stories, for lack of a better term. It was a distinct shift that led to the next decade of films.You didn’t get much opportunity to do comedy until fairly deep into your career, and now it’s a real strength — Cliff is such a sly, funny character. Was developing that side of what you do also part of the effort to get away from the straightforward leading-man stuff? Well, I was very conscious of that when I did “Kalifornia.” It’s kind of a B film, but it was important for me. I was going against the things I was getting at the time. I got to do character work in it, and there’s humor laid in there, too. I’ve gotten to do a few comedies. They’ve just been subtle. I’m better at behavioral comedy than jokes.It’s interesting that you mention “Kalifornia.” I see that as a very method-y, flashy performance. It doesn’t strike me as pointing toward the kind of work you’re doing now. But it was another big turning point for me. After “Thelma & Louise” I was offered hitchhiker roles, which is no surprise — but you would be surprised at how many hitchhiker roles there were. I was also being offered romantic leads. For me in the ’90s, there was this strict imprint of what a leading man was. It felt limiting. So what I’m pinpointing with “Kalifornia” is a moment in which you can tell yourself that the box is bigger than the one you’re being defined in.I think an example of the kind of behavioral comedy you just described is Cliff’s LSD scene in “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” — at least before he starts bashing heads. Actually, wait, I’m curious: Have you taken LSD? Who, me?Yeah, you. Oh, sure. Oh, sure.The way you said that suggests more than a passing familiarity. [laughs] I’m microdosing right now.You’re holding it together nicely. By the way, that was brilliant of Quentin. He came up with that a couple of weeks before we started shooting. We already had the script, and then he said, “You’re going to be on acid in that scene.” I said, “Great!” It gives you so much room. The clichés of acid trails; it’s always funny. Everyone gets it. But the scene might’ve played the same way without acid: Cliff would find it so damn funny that he was having a normal night and then these bozos show up at his house. He was feeling the opposite of fear. There would have been humor for Cliff regardless. It was just amplified on acid.Let me ask you this: A movie like “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” is so much about how certain kinds of cultural figures and images evoke particular associations and memories. And along those lines, it’s not some brilliant leap of interpretation to suggest that our — and the movie’s — awareness of a “Brad Pitt” persona affects our feelings about Cliff Booth. As an actor, are you aware of how the audience’s idea of you can resonate with a role? No.Really? That resonance feels so central to the pleasure of the movie. The answer is no. I mean, I’m aware of when a director is using my persona really well. Fincher in “Fight Club” was twisting it. In “Jesse James,” it was pretty blatant. But no, I’m not really aware, and I’m not sure I should be. I stopped reading all press about 2004. Not just reviews. I mean any magazine in the doctor’s office. Because some of it would bounce around like a rat in the skull. It would stay there, and it would inform some of my decisions and choices in work, in life, and I didn’t find any of it helpful.People always say they don’t read about themselves. I never believe it. I don’t go out of my way to avoid it; I just don’t seek it out. I don’t know how many women they’ve said I’ve been dating the last two or three years, and none of it’s true — I just flashed on something, but maybe it doesn’t mean anything.What? When I first started my career, I was in USA Today. I was pretty pleased with myself. Two days after it came out, I go over to a friend-of-a-friend’s house. In the kitchen I look down and there’s a litter box for the cat — and there’s my piece in USA Today with a cat turd on top of it. That pretty much defines it.This is a different, probably more embarrassing version of the question about your persona: Are your looks a tool you can use or subvert to particular actorly effect? No.How could the answer be no? What about all this business about actors and their instrument? Yeah, but you don’t know how you read. I’ve had moments where I’ve seen pictures of myself from years ago and gone, “That kid looks all right.” But I didn’t feel that way inside. I spent most of the ’90s hiding out and smoking pot. I was too uncomfortable with all the attention. Then I got to a place where I was aware that I was imprisoning myself. Now I go out and live life, and generally people are pretty cool. I just flashed on something else: When I was a kid, I loved the Harlem Globetrotters. When they came to my town, it was a big deal. We had seats up in the bleachers, but I sneaked down and sat in the front row, and Meadowlark pulled me out of the crowd. I was the kid for the thing when they threw the bucket of water, you know?You’re talking about Meadowlark Lemon’s famous Globetrotters bit where his water bucket is filled with confetti? Yeah. And I remember how when that happened I felt as if I had been touched by someone great. So what I’m getting at is that after I stopped hiding out, once I got back out in the world, I realized that you have that ability to make someone feel good for a moment. I’m not trying to say anyone is being brushed with my greatness. I’m trying to say that I have the opportunity to brighten someone’s day. That’s a rare thing.
NASA said Tuesday it is working with Tom Cruise to film a movie on the International Space Station, but details on the arrangements are scarce.The news that Cruise was in talks with to shoot an action-adventure film on the space station was first reported Monday by Deadline, which said the actor is working with SpaceX on the project.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted Tuesday that the agency is “excited to work Tom Cruise on a film aboard the space station. We need popular media to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists to make NASA’s ambitious plans a reality.”Cruise, the 57-year-old star of Top Gun and the Mission: Impossible film franchise, has performed daring stunts before. NASA did not confirm Tuesday whether Cruise would himself fly to the space station as part of the film.SpaceX has not confirmed its role in the film project, but Cruise could fly to the space station on the company’s Crew Dragon spaceship. The Crew Dragon is designed to carry up to four people to and from low Earth orbit, potentially room enough for Cruise, a small film crew and a professional astronaut in command.Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, tweeted Tuesday: “Should be a lot of fun!”NASA last year said it would enable private astronauts to spend up to 30 days on the International Space Station. The paying passengers would fly to the station on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft or Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner crew capsule, the two human-rated spaceships developed by U.S. industry in partnership with NASA.Private companies would pay for access to the orbiting research outpost, and the commercial companies would be responsible for funding the flight’s launch and trip to the space station.Earlier this year, the space tourism company Space Adventures — which arranged the flight of Garriott and other wealthy passengers to the station on Russian spacecraft — announced an agreement with SpaceX to fly paying passengers on a Crew Dragon spacecraft without going to the space station. Instead, the Crew Dragon contracted by Space Adventures will fly on its own in Earth orbit, reaching altitudes hundreds of miles above the space station to provide passengers a more expansive view of Earth.Axiom Space said in March that it signed a contract with SpaceX to ferry a professional astronaut and three paying passengers to the International Space Station as soon as next year.Deadline reported Monday that the film project is “real” but in the “early stages” of development. No studio is attached yet to the film, Deadline reported.Cruise narrated the 2002 IMAX documentary film Space Station 3D, which was filmed by astronauts during the assembly of the International Space Station. A short science fiction film named Apogee of Fear was filmed on the space station in 2008 by Richard Garriott, who paid for his trip to orbit on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.But celebrity spaceflights and past plans for filmmaking projects in orbit have faltered before reaching the launch pad.Singer Lance Bass of NSYNC began training to fly on a Soyuz mission to the space station in 2002, but his sponsorships fell through. A Russian actor hoped to fly to the Russian space station Mir in 2000, but the project collapsed due to lack of funds. 
Voters go to the polls in the United Kingdom on Thursday for the most important general election in decades. The vote was triggered by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in order to secure a large enough parliamentary majority to push through Brexit after three years of deadlock.Opinion polls suggest the result is incredibly uncertain, with both a landslide majority for Johnson's Conservative Party or another hung parliament, highly feasible outcomes.A Johnson victory would mean that Britain would likely leave the EU at the end of January 2020, before immediately entering an 11-month transition period during which Johnson would seek to negotiate a new trade deal with the EU.However, if Johnson falls short, then the parliamentary mathematics means that opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn would be favourite to become prime minister of a new coalition government.If that happens then the UK would head rapidly for a second referendum on Brexit and a radical left-wing domestic programme which could completely change the economic settlement in the UK.Either way, the result on Friday is set to be a dramatic one, the impact of which will be felt around the world.Too close to call?The UK polling industry has had a shaky record in recent elections, with most pollsters calling the outcome of the last three general elections largely wrong.The polls in this year's contest are particularly variable with some pollsters forecasting a landslide Johnson win while others suggest the UK is heading for yet another hung parliament.Where all the pollsters agree is that Johnson's Conservatives will be the largest party. However, merely being the largest party won't necessarily be enough for Johnson to cling onto Downing Street.With little to no allies among opposition parties, Johnson would likely lose his party's grip on power if he fails to win an outright majority. Corbyn's Labour party, on the other hand, would be favourites to form a government, possibly with the support of the Scottish National Party or the Liberal Democrats.However, the margins are very fine and it is possible that there will be no viable coalition for either a Conservative or Labour government. If that is the case then Britain is heading for yet more political uncertainty and a probable further general election in the new year.The Brexit election?Johnson has sought, with some success, to frame this election as being about Brexit. This has enabled him to forge a coalition of support which contains both former supporters of Nigel Farage's Brexit Party as well as many former Labour voters, who voted to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.This strategy has led to many formerly safe Labour seats in parts of Northern England, to become targets for Johnson's party.However, the flipside of this strategy is that some southern seats, which were formerly safely held by Johnson's party are now up for grabs by other pro-European parties. That has led to several high-profile members of Johnson's government, including Johnson himself, at risk of losing their seats.Johnson's strategy has also come somewhat unstuck in the final weeks of the campaign as opposition parties have been successful in framing the campaign on other issues.An end to austerity?A decade of public sector cuts, initiated by David Camerons' Conservative-led government in 2010 has led to many public services in the UK struggling to cope. Under particular strain is the publicly-funded National Health Service, which recent statistics suggest is failing to cope with rising demand for its services.The funding and staffing crisis in the NHS has dominated the latter stages of this campaign with a picture of a four-year-old boy forced to lay on the floor while waiting for emergency care, becoming a focal point of the final days of campaigning. A viral clip of Johnson refusing to look at a picture of the boy, before snatching a reporter's phone away as he was trying to show the prime minister the photo, became a huge moment in the campaign and symbolised what Johnson's opponents claim is his inability to empathise with the general public.Both the opposition Labour party and Johnson himself have sought to capitalise on public concern over healthcare in the UK, with Johnson promising new funding and Labour's Jeremy Corbyn warning that Johnson will "sell-off" the NHS as part of a post-Brexit trade deal with the NHS.Leaked documents, released by Corbyn, detailing talks about drug pricing between the UK and US governments, also became a major focal point in the campaign.A battle between two political radicalsIf Corbyn defies the polls and emerges as the winner of today's election, then he plans to radically change the direction of the UK. His party's manifesto promises a massive programme of nationalisation of key industries as well as huge increases in public spending.His proposals, including free broadband for all UK citizens, have been met positively by many voters according to the polls while being ridiculed by others.However, despite significant uncertainty over the result, the most likely outcome still remains that Boris Johnson will be successful in gaining the parliamentary majority he seeks.If he is successful then it will mean that Britain is heading for a radically different economic and political settlement outside of the frame of the European Union.Johnson's commitment to diverge from trade and customs regulations with the EU will put the future of many UK businesses, which rely on close trading ties with Europe, at risk. Similarly, Johnson's plan to forge a closer relationship with the US will inevitably mean that Britain has to alter its long-held food and trading standards in ways that will prove deeply controversial.Johnson is a mercurial political figure who has a record of being socially liberal while Mayor of London but economically Conservative since re-entering parliament and becoming the leader of his party. His party's manifesto is short on detail leaving opponents fearful that he will seek to dramatically change the shape of Britain's political landscape if he is victorious on Friday. Whatever happens, British voters have a momentous decision in their hands as they head to the polls on Thursday.
(CNN)A nationalist tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party has dismissed claims by the Trump administration that the novel coronavirus originated from a laboratory, as the war of words over the pandemic escalates between Washington and Beijing.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday in an interview with ABC that there was "enormous evidence" Covid-19 originated in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected last December. He did not provide details to support the claim.Responding to Pompeo's comments, China's state owned Global Times newspaper said in an editorial Monday that the former CIA director had "stunned the world with groundless accusations.""Since Pompeo said his claims are supported by 'enormous evidence,' then he should present this so-called evidence to the world, and especially to the American public who he continually tries to fool," the editorial said."The truth is that Pompeo does not have any evidence, and during Sunday's interview, he was bluffing."CNN reached out to China's foreign ministry for comment on Pompeo's claims, but received no response. The country is in the middle of a five-day holiday that runs through Tuesday.Scientists around the world have condemned conspiracy theories suggesting that Covid-19 does not have a natural origin, pointing to studies that suggest it originated in wildlife.China has faced criticism at home and abroad over its handling of the virus, especially during the initial outbreak. It was accused of silencing whistle-blowers and delaying in informing the public about the severity of the crisis.But critics allege Washington has ramped up efforts to blame China for the global spread of the virus as it faces growing criticism at home for its own handling of the pandemic. To date, the US has recorded more than 1.1 million cases and at least 67,000 Covid-19 related deaths.Beijing has hit back with its own propaganda efforts, accusing the US of shifting blame and brushing aside accusations of a deliberate coverup in the critical early stages.Last Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang accused "American politicians" of telling lies about the pandemic."They have only one objective: to try to shirk responsibility for their own epidemic and prevention and control measures and divert public attention," he said.On April 30, China's state-run news agency Xinhua posted an animated video featuring Lego-like figures that mocked the US response to the pandemic. It has been viewed for 1.9 million times on Twitter.On Monday, the Global Times editorial accused the White House of continuing to "engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.""As the US presidential election campaigns are underway, the Trump administration has implemented a strategy designed to divert attention from the incompetence it has displayed in fighting the pandemic. It is clear that their goal is to blame China for the pandemic by pinpointing the country as the source of Covid-19," it said.Origins of the virusThe coronavirus has infected more than 3.5 million people worldwide, with at least 247,000 dead. The US accounts for nearly a third of the global confirmed cases and more than one fourth of the deaths.Pompeo's remarks followed US President Donald Trump's claims on Thursday that he had seen evidence that gave him a "high degree of confidence" the virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan. Trump declined to provide details to back up his assertion.Scientists in China and the West have pointed to research indicating that the virus is likely to have originated in bats and jumped to humans from an intermediate host -- just like its cousin that caused the SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence also said in a statement Thursday that the "Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified."Asked Sunday about that conclusion, Pompeo said he has "no reason to disbelieve" the intelligence community, despite comments earlier in the same interview that "the best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point."Chinese officials and state media have repeatedly stressed that there has been no conclusion on the exact origin of the virus, while pushing their own unfounded claims alleging it did not originate in China. In March, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, promoted a conspiracy theory on Twitter that the virus had originated in the US and was brought to China by the US military.The ire of BeijingSo far, Chinese officials and state media have largely avoided directly naming Trump in its coverage of the spat. Instead, much of Beijing's ire has been directed at Pompeo -- and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who does not hold any current position in the administration.Last week, the state-run broadcaster CGTN accused Pompeo of turning "his back on humanity by spreading a political virus." The Chinese Communist Party's official mouthpiece, the People's Daily, also said in an editorial that Pompeo's rhetoric will deliver the US a "colossal moral deficit."On Monday, the Global Times said Pompeo was "indulging in a solo performance that has failed to adhere to the professional standards expected for a chief diplomat," and accused him of losing "his moral compass."State media also bristled at Bannon after he criticized China's handling of the outbreak in an interview with CNBC on Thursday and suggested Beijing should be held financially responsible for the pandemic.On Sunday night, state broadcaster CCTV aired a commentary during its flagship evening newscast that lashed out at Bannon, calling him a "stubborn anti-China figure" with "zero moral integrity." 
We test how the $399 iPhone SE and its single rear camera compares to the $699 iPhone 11 and its dual rear cameras. It's not as straightforward as it seems. Despite widespread enthusiasm for Apple's $399 price tag for its new iPhone SE, there was a lot of speculation about the camera hardware and how it might compare to the more expensive iPhone 11. Its rear camera has the same specs as those of the iPhone 8 from 2017, but some theorized that it might have the sensor from 2018's iPhone XR.Read more: iPhone SE 2020 is proof that Apple won't actually bring back the tiny phoneIt took an iFixIt teardown of the new iPhone to show that the SE was actually packing the same lens and sensor as the iPhone 8. That means all the improvements to image quality as well as the addition of features like Portrait Mode, come purely from the A13 Bionic chip. This processor is the same one found in the $699 iPhone 11.Since both phones have the same processor, naturally I wanted to compare photos and videos. To date, the iPhone 11 phones have not only the best cameras on any iPhone, but one of the best all-around camera systems on any phone.The iPhone SE has a lot to live up to, but as you will see, it can go toe-to-toe with its pricier Apple siblings. This comparison shows that when it comes to photography and recording videos, the real consideration isn't the number of megapixels or number of cameras. Instead, it's all about the processor.iPhone SE vs. 11: SmartHDR makes photos look fantasticThe combination of the A13 Bionic chip and iOS 13 absolutely raises the iPhone 8's camera hardware to the next level on the SE. The iPhone SE's rear camera has a 28mm f1.8 lens, while the iPhone 11 has two rear cameras: a main one with a 26mm f1.8 lens and an ultrawide-angle camera with a 13mm f2.4 lens. Since the 11 has an ultrawide-angle camera and the SE doesn't, there isn't much to compare. But here are a couple of my favorite photos that I took with the ultrawide-camera anywayWhen I focused on the main cameras of each, I noticed that in good light, photos were nearly indistinguishable. Look at the pictures of a tree I took in my backyard below and you won't be able to tell much of a difference. The iPhone SE photo is framed ever-so-slightly tighter than the iPhone 11. But in every other way (even when I zoomed into each to 100% on a large monitor) I couldn't see any other differences.Take a look at the photos I took of some wood slats. Again, aside from framing, it's hard to see any difference. When I zoomed in, details from each photo were good. Both had small amounts of image noise in the shadows of the slats.The reason photos in good light look so similar is that whether you're on an iPhone 11, 11 Pro or the new SE, the latest version of SmartHDR is used to process and optimize details and textures. It also pushes the dynamic range as much as possible without the image falling apart.Here is where we start to see some differences between the two phones. The photo below of a tree showcases the strength of SmartHDR processing. This scene has lighting extremes with dark shadows under the tree and bright highlights in the clouds. Look closely at the iPhone 11 photo and you can see the shadows have more detail and aren't as dark as the iPhone SE. In the sky through the branches, you see that both photos have blown out highlights, but the iPhone 11 has less. Though this is a minor detail, it's evidence that the main camera on the iPhone 11 handles a wider dynamic range better than the iPhone SE.Portrait mode: 1 camera vs. 2Both phones have portrait mode and produce excellent results. The 11 can take portrait mode photos of people and pets while the iPhone SE can only do people, which is a big drawback if your an animal lover. With the portrait mode photos below, you'll see that they look very similar. The iPhone 11's portrait captures more details. For example, look at the hair on John's forehead. Also, the falloff over the shoulders from in-focus to out-of-focus areas appears more natural from the iPhone 11 and that might be due to the fact that it uses both rear lenses to create the effect.Deep fusion processing for medium to low-lightWhen we get into medium- and low-light environments, the differences between the two phones are even starker. That's because the iPhone 11 has Deep Fusion processing which improves image quality, details and minimizes image noise. The iPhone SE lacks Deep Fusion.The photos below are of my bike trainer taken indoors in medium lighting. Besides the tighter framing in the iPhone SE photo, there is a notable difference in terms of image quality. The photo from the 11 have a pinch more detail, like around the wall outlet.In addition, the bottom right corner of the iPhone SE's photo suffers from image noise in the shadows. I'd say that for indoor and medium light photos, the 11 has the edge because its use of Deep Fusion processing. Night mode vs. no night modeNight mode, which is on the iPhone 11 but not the SE, is another sizable difference between the two phones. Night mode uses adaptive bracketing, taking a series of images with various shutter speeds. It combines them into a single photo that is brighter, has less image noise and improved details. Like the iPhone 11's ultrawide-angle camera, your own preferences will dictate whether having night mode is a deal-breaker. But let's see what it can do.Below are photos of a tree in my backyard taken when it was extremely dark. The iPhone 11 night mode looks better in every way.But that was a pretty extreme way to test the phones. Below is a slightly brighter low-light scene of a book, an eye drop bottle and my computer. It was dim enough to trigger night mode on the iPhone 11.As you can see if you look closely at the bottle of eye drops, the iPhone 11's photo is sharper, has better details and color accuracy. Finally, compare the author names on the spine of the book. The text looks softer in the SE photo and the book's spine is slightly a different color.Rear camera video is nearly identicalLike photos in good light, it's also difficult to discern video recording between the main rear cameras on both phones. Both phones can shoot up to 4K, 60 fps and have extended dynamic range (aka: "HDR" but for video). However, the 11 offers extended dynamic range up to 4K 60fps, whereas the iPhone SE can only support it up to 4K 30fps.Take a look at the video below which contains footage filmed from both the iPhone 11 and SE.Now playing: iPhone SE (2020) vs. iPhone 11: We compare cameras to...10:50As you can see from 4K, 60fps the footage, both videos look similar. But if you look closer, the speaker on the shelf behind me looks more contrasted in the iPhone 11 video. The lamp over my shoulder in the iPhone 11 video also isn't blown out, whereas in the iPhone SE video it is. That's due to the iPhone 11's extended dynamic range at 4K 60fps.To see more videos filmed with the iPhone SE, watch the video below.Front-facing camera: More detailed selfies and 'slowfie' videoVideos taken with the front-facing cameras, however, show a larger difference in quality. The iPhone 11 has a wider front-facing camera, and it's capable of 4K and slow-mo videos. The iPhone SE can only shoot 1,080p video and can't shoot "slofies." Both can take portrait photos, but the iPhone 11 captures much more detail (in my hair and skin, for example). Some people might not miss seeing all those details in their skin.In terms of video from the front-facing cameras, you can really see the difference in resolution and hear it in the audio. Video from the iPhone 11 sounds better and has more clarity than from the iPhone SE. Again, check out the video that accompanies this article to watch video shot with the front-facing cameras.After doing this camera comparison, it's obvious that the iPhone 11 has a better and more versatile camera system. But in many situations, the iPhone SE was able to capture images that are as comparable and brilliant, despite being hundreds of dollars cheaper than the iPhone 11.
After years of complaints over sticky or unresponsive keys, Apple has finally finished transitioning its notebook lineup away from its issue-prone butterfly keyboard.With the new 13-inch MacBook Pro featuring the same scissor switch Magic Keyboard as the 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple no longer sells any new MacBook Pro or MacBook Air models with a butterfly keyboard. If you are browsing Apple's refurbished store, however, be aware that many of those models are still equipped with the butterfly keyboard.First introduced on the 16-inch MacBook Pro last year, the Magic Keyboard features a redesigned scissor mechanism with 1mm of key travel, an inverted-"T" arrangement for the arrow keys, and a physical Escape key next to the Touch Bar.Models with more reliable Magic Keyboard:2019 16-inch MacBook Pro2020 13-inch MacBook Pro2020 MacBook AirApple's butterfly keyboard suffered from issues with sticky, repeating, or nonfunctional keys. The company continues to offer free repairs to affected customers as part of its worldwide service program, and it even apologized over the matter last year, although it downplayed the issue and said that only a "small number" of customers were impacted. 
Skype  is capitalizing on Apple’s struggles with Group FaceTime to attract attention to its own group calling features. Today, the company announced it’s doubling the number of people who can simultaneously participate in a group audio or video call. It now supports as many as 50 people at once, up from 25, previously.With the expanded support for more participants, Skype tops the abilities of other popular messaging apps like WhatsApp, Google Hangouts and Instagram, and instead competes more directly with enterprise-grade calling solutions like Zoom, for example, which supports up to 100 or even 1,000 participants, depending on the plan, with up to 49 webcams displayed in its gallery view.Skype isn’t as robust, but offers something in between an enterprise platform and consumer apps.Skype also one-ups Facebook Messenger, which allows 50 people to join a chat but limits the screen to show only the speaker after more than a half-dozen people join in. On Skype, participants are shown in bubbles across the top of the screen and the end-user can choose whose feed they want to focus on in a multi-paned main window.Notably, Skype’s update also puts it ahead of Apple’s FaceTime, which now supports up to 32 people on group calls as of iOS 12.1.But Group FaceTime has experienced some issues in recent months. A teenager found a security bug that allowed users to eavesdrop before calls were picked up. Apple disabled the feature, fixed the bug, then re-enabled Group FaceTime with February’s release of iOS 12.1.4. But the update also introduced a change to how the app works, as it required users have to have at least three people on a FaceTime call to begin with before they could use the “Add Person” button.Skype, on the other hand, is simplifying how video calls start with the new release.For groups with less than 25 participants, you can just ring the entire group at once, the company says.And for larger calls, Skype added a notification option to replace ringing as the default. That means participants get a less obstructive, ping-style alert to join the call.These features were previously in testing back in March, but today they’re rolling out to the public across platforms.To use these new features, you’ll need to download the latest version of Skype.
IN THE TWILIGHT of July 1, 1916, 25-year-old Charles Vansant bled to death in a beachfront hotel in New Jersey. Several men had pulled his maimed body from the water.Five days later, bellhop Charles Bruder, 27, was killed during an afternoon swim along the Jersey Shore. Beachgoers gathered around his legless remains.The following week, 10-year-old Lester Stilwell was swimming in Matawan Creek (also in New Jersey) with his friends when he was eaten alive. Naked and covered in mud, the terrified boys ran down Main Street screaming that there was a shark in the water.But people were skeptical. They thought Stilwell, who was epileptic, had drowned. Some had been dismissive of the newspaper reports that said sharks had killed swimmers on the coast, because Americans at this time were fairly certain … sharks didn't bite people.People knew sharks ate the flesh of other ocean creatures, but there was dispute over whether they would—or could—bring down a human. But after the attacks in New Jersey in 1916, what were once thought to be frightening-looking yet essentially benign animals became man-eating predators. This new attitude brought us Jaws and Sharknado, and it’s seen in the response to real-life shark attacks. But it took the New Jersey attacks more than a century ago to remind humans just where they are on the food chain.When Watson Fisher, a tailor, went into the creek to look for Stilwell, he was attacked as well. He later died of blood loss. Thirty minutes later, a shark bit 14-year-old Joseph Dunn’s leg. Dunn’s brother and a local sea captain pulled him to safety.That night, some of the local men fought back. They tossed sticks of dynamite into the creek.On the day Stilwell’s body was found, President Woodrow Wilson called a Cabinet meeting. The White House agreed to give federal aid to “drive away all the ferocious man-eating sharks which have been making prey of bathers,” according to a July 14, 1916 article in the Philadelphia Inquirer.Eventually, an eight-foot juvenile great white shark was pulled from the New Jersey waters. Its stomach contained human remains.How we used to think about sharksMillionaire and athlete Hermann Oelrichs was sure that no shark had ever bitten a human.He was so sure that in 1891, Oelrichs offered $500 ($12,000 in today’s dollars) to anyone who could prove him wrong. He was so sure that once, when he hosted a party at his seaside home, he jumped in the water with a shark to settle a $250 bet with his guests, according to an 1891 Pittsburg Dispatch article.Some partygoers screamed and covered their eyes. Others called for help. But the fish swam away, possibly frightened by the splash. Oelrichs later repeated this stunt on his yacht.He was not alone. Many—though not all—scientists of the day believed sharks were harmless. Reports of American shark attacks were often dismissed as fisherman’s tales.According to Michael Capuzzo’s 2001 book on the attacks, Close to Shore: The Terrifying Shark Attacks of 1916, scientists at the American Museum of Natural History in New York cited Oelrichs as scientific evidence that man-eating sharks did not exist.When John Treadwell Nichols, assistant curator of the Department of Recent Fishes at the museum, examined the body of Charles Bruder, the bellhop killed in New Jersey, he declared an orca, or killer whale, had killed him, not a shark, writes Capuzzo. A prominent ichthyologist (fish scientist), Nichols did not believe a shark could kill a human.Some suggested it was a massive sea turtle, or a school of sea turtles that snapped at Bruder and Vansant, says George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research and curator for the International Shark Attack File.Scientists had a loose grasp on shark behavior.“There were all kinds of misconceptions,” Burgess says. “At least one school of thought at the time was this was all stuff of rumors and fabrications.”In an August 2, 1915 New York Times editorial, “Let Us Do Justice to the Sharks,” included in Close to Shore, the editors wrote, “To this day, there is nothing that will so quickly set a crowd of swimmers scurrying for our beaches as the sight of a shark’s fin in the offing … that sharks can properly be called dangerous, in this part of the world, is apparently untrue.”Burgess says as the bites continued, it eventually became obvious that sharks were attacking.The ocean is still wildAttacks attributed to a single shark are extremely uncommon.Burgess says he knows of only a handful of other examples, such as a series of attacks off the Red Sea resort Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt in 2010, when one tourist was killed and three gravely injured by an oceanic whitetip.There’s some debate if a bull shark was responsible for the deaths in Matawan Creek because they are known to inhabit fresh and brackish waters; however, Burgess says the evidence points to the young great white. (Watch: "Attack of the Mystery Shark: Is a Bull or Great White Shark the Culprit?")The New Jersey shark attacks sent a message to people in the United States. They said the ocean is still wild. Ocean swimming was a relatively new form of entertainment in 1916. When Americans embraced it, they took their first step into the world of sharks. The culture shock was natural, says Burgess.“It was a unique situation then, [but] it clearly doesn’t matter where it occurs and when,” Burgess says. “Whenever a community encounters a number of incidents in a short period of time, the community reacts more or less the same … The usual order of things is usually fear, followed by denial, followed by revenge, and then followed by some rational or scientific approach to the problem. It’s a timeless and cultural-ist reaction.”
Versace is going after Fashion Nova. The Italian luxury brand filed a lawsuit against the fast-fashion store alleging copyright infringement on Monday, accusing it of "brazenly" copying several of its most iconic prints and designs.These designs included its green "jungle print" dress that was famously worn by Jennifer Lopez to the 2000 Grammy Awards. Lopez donned the dress again this September at a Versace fashion show to celebrate 20 years since its first appearance, sending social media into a meltdown. "Fashion Nova's infringing apparel is plainly a deliberate effort to exploit the popularity and renown of Versace's signature designs, and to trade on Versace's valuable goodwill and business reputation in order to drive profits and sales to line Fashion Nova's pockets," Versace's lawyers wrote in a lawsuit filed in the central district court of California on Tuesday. The court documents included a series of side-by-side photos, which they used to highlight the alleged copyright issues. This isn't the first time that Fashion Nova has been served with a lawsuit of this kind. According to these court documents, it has been sued at least eight times over copyright-related matters previously. A spokesperson for Fashion Nova declined to comment on the lawsuit and its allegations. Versace was not immediately available for comment. Fashion Nova initially started off as a mall-based store but kicked off its online business in 2013. The premise from the start has been to offer ultra-fast, ultra-cheap, and ultra-trendy clothes to its customers. To do so, it has a speedy supply chain in place with many of its manufacturers being located close to the Los Angeles area, where its headquarters are. Items can be bought from the design floor to production in as little as 48 hours, enabling it to roll out more than 1,000 new items each week. Many of these items are quickly photographed and posted on Instagram, where its millions of followers can scroll through its latest designs.  But Versace said that this ultra-fast fashion model comes at a price for other designers.Its "ability to churn out new clothing so quickly is due in large part to its willingness to copy the copyrighted designs, trademarks and trade dress elements of well-known designers such as Versace, and trade on their creative efforts in order to bolster Fashion Nova's bottom line," the lawsuit said.It continued: "Versace seeks to bring an end to Fashion Nova's latest brazen attempt at copying the work of yet another famous and world-renowned designer."
The coronavirus pandemic has changed a lot of things, but one thing that it hasn't changed is Apple releasing new products. And benchmarks test results suggest that Apple has a new 13-inch MacBook Pro in the works.Well, maybe it won't be the 13-inch model, but more on that in a moment.Must read: Can a simple charging mistake cause your MacBook Pro to overheat?Twitter user @_rogame discovered 3DMark benchmarks for the new MacBook Pro.As you might imagine, there's not a whole lot of information.    Intel Core i7-1068NG7 2.3GHz base 4.1GHz boost processor    32GB of RAM    2/4TB SSDThe i7-1068NG7 processor is a 10th-gen Intel Ice Lake-U chip that as of yet has not been officially confirmed yet. The switch to Ice Lake-U from Whiskey Lake-U is likely to be a significant performance boost. Given the spec of this system, it seems to be a high-end offering and would cost in excess of $3,000. It's likely that Apple would release a more affordable version powered by a Core i5 processor too. The most interesting this about this "leak" is the suggestion that this may not be a 13-inch MacBook Pro, but instead a new 14-inch model -- Apple's bumped the 15-inch MBP to 16-inch, so why not upgrade the 13-inch to 14-inch?
Everyone needs something super right now, so mother nature is serving up a dazzling display in the night sky.A meteor shower from Halley’s Comet will peak Tuesday. But, a nearly full moon will make it hard to see in the northern hemisphere.That nearly full moon will turn into a supermoon on Thursday morning.If you go outside and look up, you’ll see a supermoon, the last one of four we’ll see this year. It’s a supermoon because it’s so close to earth right now.This particular moon is called the flower moon, which makes sense considering how much is in bloom right now. The moon will actually look full for three days starting Tuesday night through Friday morning.If you miss the meteor shower on Tuesday because of the bright supermoon, stargazers might have another chance to see the shower just before dawn next Sunday.This year, the Eta Aquariid meteor shower coincides with the supermoon on May 7.Otherwise, as with the famed Halley’s Comet, there’s always next year. Earth crosses the comet’s orbital path each spring between April and May.Halley’s Comet itself won’t be visible again until at least 2061.
Michael Jordan was a notorious competitor on the court, always looking for an edge, no matter how minute. The six-time NBA champion was the same way at home, pushing his kids to be their best. He didn’t take it easy on them in basketball, either.“He would treat us exactly the same as any other basketball player he was playing,” one of Jordan’s sons, Marcus, said on NBC’s “Today” show to discuss the documentary, “The Last Dance,” that chronicles his legendary father’s final season with the Bulls.Jordan and his two sons, Marcus and Jeffrey, would often play a game of one-on-one-on-one against each other. Whoever scored got to keep the ball.“The game got so competitive [one time], to the point I literally had to call my mom, [and tell her], ‘Dad’s picking on me,’ ” Marcus said. “I was a freshman in high school. There was nothing given. You had to earn everything.”Marcus played three of college basketball at Central Florida from 2009-11, averaging 12.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game. Jeffrey also played in college, for Illinois and Central Florida from 2007-12, averaging 1.6 points per game between the two programs.
