Emma, the U.K. money management app (now calling itself your “best financial friend”), has launched in the United States and Canada — and is now one of a plethora of London fintechs venturing States-side.Competing banking app Cleo entered the U.S. nine months ago, and challenger bank Monzo is thought to be gearing up to launch across the pond soon, to name just two.Emma says the U.S. launch comes after partnering with Plaid, the U.S.-based fintech that specialises in bank account aggregation. The London startup says that with its U.S. launch, 350 million people will now be able to have access to Emma’s money management features.Described as your “financial friend,” the Emma app connects to your bank accounts (and crypto wallets) to help you budget, track spending and save money. It aims to help you understand things like how much money you have left to spend until your next payday, track and find wasteful subscriptions and preemptively avoid going into your bank’s overdraft.The PFM-styled app was launched in the U.K. in January 2018 and claims more than 100,000 downloads in just a year “without any marketing spend.” Furthermore, the company says users open the app five times a week, twice a day and are using it as a “true alternative” to their traditional banking app.
The Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling car in the UK last month, as new car sales dropped 97% as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show that 658 Model 3s were sold in April, accounting for around 15% of all new car sales. With dealerships closed and customers adhering to the nationwide stay-at-home directive, just 4321 new cars were sold in April, down from 161,064 in the same period last year.The Model 3 led an unusual list of the 10 best-selling cars in April, with the UK's traditional biggest sellers largely absent. The list featured both electric cars such as the Model 3 and Jaguar I-Pace, and MPVs including the Ford Tourneo Custom and Peugeot Rifter. UK new car registrations fall 97% in April due to coronavirus lockdownThis is the second time Tesla’s entry-level electric saloon has appeared in the UK top 10, it having been a strong seller here since its arrival in early 2019. In February 2019, it became Europe’s best-selling electric vehicle in its first full month on sale outside the US, but it still accounts for just 0.9% sales in the UK so far this year. The model's releatively high sales can be attributed to the completion of online pre-orders made on Tesla's website before the lockdown. A number of sales are also likely to be to company fleets - which the SMMT says accounted for 70% of all sales in April. Recent changes introduced to the UK vehicle excise duty system saw EVs become exempt from benefit-in-kind tax, thus enhancing their appeal for fleet buyers. That’s backed up by sales figures for Jaguar’s electric I-Pace SUV, which was the second-highest seller in April with 367 units sold. Earlier this year, the British marque reached a deal to supply 700 I-Paces to the NHS for use by healthcare workers, with the first expected to arrive in April. The SMMT expects electric vehicles to perform relatively strongly in 2020, bucking an overall industry decline to double their market share by the end of the year with an estimated 77,300 units sold.The Vauxhall Corsa placed third in the list, with 264 units sold. In March, the supermini came in at number six with more than 20 times as many sales. Vauxhall’s larger Crossland X crossover placed fourth with 143 units sold. 
Foreign ministers from the G7 group of nations will discuss the threat of a resurgence in Libya's civil war at a meeting in western France on Friday, as world powers scrambled to defuse a dangerous escalation in the oil producer's power struggle.A military advance towards Tripoli and Libya's U.N. backed government by eastern commander Khalifa Haftar has taken the United Nations by surprise, just as its secretary general was in the capital to plan a peace conference later this month.Shortly before the summit began, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the G7 was monitoring the situation with a great deal of concern."Libya is likely to be at the heart of exchanges today and tomorrow. It will be looked at in detail, hopefully to allow us to move forward and avoid the situation getting worse," a senior French diplomat said.Concern over Libya's stability is heightened by continuing political tensions around Europe over migration from north Africa, despite the fact that the numbers of new arrivals in Europe via the central Mediterranean have plummeted.French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian welcomed his counterparts from the club of big rich nations under a dull grey sky in Brittany, for a meeting overshadowed by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's absence and Britain's Brexit meltdown.French diplomats say Paris has scaled back its ambitions for France's presidency of the club of big rich countries, after U.S. President Donald Trump threw last year's summit in Canda into disarray, backing out of a joint communique and firing barbs at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The French diplomat sought to downplay Pompeo's snub saying: "We're working well with the Americans. Yes, we have differences on some subjects, but that isn't holding back the quality of our dialogue."BREXIT LOOMS LARGEWorkers at dawn had furiously scrubbed away at graffiti spray-painted onto buildings near the secure zone in Dinard that attacked capitalism and President Emmanuel Macron.The slogans screamed "Thieving banks", "Revolution" and "No to the G7", mirroring the anger vented across France in five months of anti-government "yellow vest" protests fuelled by perceptions of a growing rich-poor divide and aloof politicians.The summit is expected to result in three joint statements on cyber security, sexual violence against women in armed conflict and trafficking in the Sahel region, and not too much wrangling over issues where there is less consensus such as Iran and Russia.Britain's Hunt said he would use the summit to call on his European counterparts to support his government's request for a short delay to Britain's exit from the EU.British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote to Brussels on Friday asking for a delay of Brexit until up to June 30, while saying she aims to get Britain out of the EU earlier to avoid it participating in European elections."What we are looking for is to avoid a long extension," Hunt said. "We are a democracy with a hung parliament, so it's not easy."Hunt said the G7 was proof Britain would not play a diminished international role after Brexit.

The prospect of mining asteroids and the Moon is on a lot of peoples’ minds lately. Maybe it’s all the growth that’s happened in the commercial aerospace industry in the past few decades. Or perhaps it’s because of Trump’s recent executive order to allow for asteroid and lunar mining. Either way, there is no shortage of entrepreneurs and futurists who can’t wait to start prospecting and harvest the natural bounty of space!Coincidentally enough, future lunar miners now have a complete map of the lunar surface, which was created by the US Geological Society’s (USGS) Astrogeology Science Center, in collaboration with NASA and the Lunar Planetary Institute (LPI). This map shows the distribution and classification of the mineral deposits on the Moon’s surface, effectively letting us know what its familiar patchwork of light and dark patches the really are.Known as the “Unified Geologic Map of the Moon,” this immensely-detailed 1:5,000,000 scale map is available online and is intended for use by the scientific community, educators, and the general public. In addition, the USGS states that it will serve as a “definitive blueprint of the moon’s surface geology for future human missions.” Said current USGS Director and former NASA astronaut Jim Reilly in a USGS statement:“People have always been fascinated by the moon and when we might return. So, it’s wonderful to see USGS create a resource that can help NASA with their planning for future missions.”To create the new digital map, scientists at the USGS synthesized data from six of the Apollo missions along with updated information from recent satellite missions. These include the Wide Angle Camera (WAC) element of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), as well as its Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) – which gathered images and topographical data on the Moon during the LRO’s ten-year mission.Then there was the elevation data of the moon’s equatorial region, which was obtained by the Terrain Camera on JAXA’s SELenological and Engineering ExpLorEr (SELENE). Also known as Kaguya, this recent mission conducted stereo observations of the Moon’s equatorial region. Mission data was from both missions was used to update the northern and southern polar regions of the Moon.In addition to merging new data and old, the USGS researchers also developed a unified description of the rock layers on the Moon (aka. stratigraphy). This resolved issues with previous maps, which included inconsistencies with names, descriptions, and ages. Said Corey Fortezzo, USGS geologist and the lead author of the study describing the map:“This map is a culmination of a decades-long project. It provides vital information for new scientific studies by connecting the exploration of specific sites on the moon with the rest of the lunar surface.”The research that led to this map was made possible due to a grant issued by the NASA Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools (PDART) program. In the coming years, the data contained within is likely to inform surface operations for Project Artemis, which are scheduled to begin in 2024 with the Artemis III mission.This will be the first time that astronauts have gone to the Moon since the Apollo era. But unlike the heady days of the Space Race, NASA is intent on establishing a program for “sustainable lunar exploration” this time around, which includes elements that will allow for a permanent human presence on the Moon – like the Lunar Gateway and the Lunar Base Camp. Commercial access to the Moon has been an important part of this plan from the beginning. In addition to partnering with aerospace companies to develop these and other elements that will make future missions to the Moon possible, NASA’s long-term plans include partnering with other space agencies and companies so that they can use this same infrastructure to facilitate their own missions and goals.On top of that, the legal precedents for commercial ventures on the Moon began before the executive order, titled “Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources.” In 2015, the Obama administration signed the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act into law to “facilitate a pro-growth environment for the developing commercial space industry.”Now that companies and individual citizens have the right to claim, own, and sell resources that they extract from asteroids and other celestial bodies, a comprehensive map of where those resources are (at least on the Moon) is going to come in mighty handy! In the meantime, it is one heck of a scientific and educational resource and is likely to lead to some exciting breakthroughs in astrogeological research. 
Star Wars has come to Facebook’s  Messenger  app. Facebook today announced a new set of Star Wars-themed features for Messenger users, including a chat theme, reactions, stickers and AR effects. The features were developed in partnership with Disney to help promote the upcoming film, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” which premieres nationwide on December 20.Both the stickers and the reactions allow users to express themselves using characters from both sides of The Force, says Facebook. For example, you can laugh like Finn, act surprised like Rey, cry like C-3PO, act angry like Kylo or give a BB-8 thumbs up or a Stormtrooper thumbs down.Disney also helped to create a set of limited-edition AR effects that can be used both while taking photos and selfies or when you’re on video calls.One, the Lightspeed Effect, gives the appearance of jumping into hyperspace. Another, the Cockpit Effect, lets you see yourself as a member of the Resistance, traveling across the galaxy in Poe Dameron’s X-Wing. The Dark vs Light Effect lets you choose your side of the Force.There’s also a Star Wars chat theme you can enable from the Messenger thread settings, which makes messages appear as if in outer space. (You access the Settings by tapping the thread’s name — typically the name or names of those you’re chatting with at the top of the screen, unless you or someone else has already renamed the chat.)All the features are free to use.This isn’t the first time Disney has partnered with a major tech company on a big marketing push around the Star Wars franchise. In 2015, Disney teamed up with Google to built out a new tool that let you theme its suite of apps, including Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps Chrome and others with either a Light Side or Dark Side effect. Facebook that year also let users change their profile photo to a Star Wars-themed pic where they posed with a red Dark Side cross-guard lightsaber or a Light Side blue one.And in 2017, Google launched an AR Stickers app with a set of licensed characters from Star Wars to promote “The Last Jedi.” Apple got on board, too, with an updated version of its Clips app with a set of new “Selfie Scenes,” including those for the Millennium Falcon and Mega-Destroyer, also from “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”These sorts of collaborations benefit both parties. In the case of this new Messenger partnership, Disney gets to market its new movie to Messenger’s more than one billion users. Meanwhile, Facebook gains increased usage and engagement for its popular Messenger app in a competitive market, where AR effects alone can be a key selling point for attracting users. As with many prior partnerships, no money exchanged hands here.The new Star Wars features are rolling out today, December 12, to Messenger.
Plans to introduce post-lockdown social distancing at airports 'won't work' and will lead to queues snaking for up to half a mile to board each large plane, Heathrow's boss warned today.Heathrow's Chief Executive John Holland-Kaye has warned that there simply isn't enough space in airports to keep each passenger two metres apart.Mr Holland-Kaye instead has called on the Prime Minister to agree an 'international standard' with other world leaders which would include passenger health checks on departure.  Mandatory health checks for passengers including taking temperatures, increased levels of hygiene and compulsory facemasks are among the options floated by Mr Holland-Kaye in order to open the nation's airports as soon as possible and avoid 'massive job losses in our sector... (and) many other sectors that depend on us'.'The Prime Minister has talked about restarting the engines of the British economy. We are ready to play our part, but first we need his help to restart the engines of the British aviation fleet,' he wrote.It came as air passengers slammed airlines for lack of social distancing after they were crammed in 'like sardines' on to rescue flights back to UK It came days after Mr Holland-Kaye told the PA news agency that it is 'just physically impossible to socially distance with any volume of passengers in an airport'.He added that social distancing on planes would reduce capacities by more than 50 per cent and mean 'prices would shoot up'.Severity of the crisis facing the aviation industry was laid bare last night as British Airways announced plans to lay off a quarter of its pilots.The nation's flag carrier told staff it planned to axe 1,130 captain and co-pilot jobs and may even abandon operations at Gatwick, Britain's second biggest airport.It came as the boss of Heathrow Airport revealed it could be the case that only young, fit and healthy people will be able to fly in the immediate future, and all passengers might have to wear face masks as part of a strategy to restore confidence in mass air travel.The dramatic developments underline the severity of the catastrophe facing Britain's aviation industry.Passenger numbers have flatlined in recent weeks due to global travel restrictions and industry leaders now accept it could take several years for passenger numbers to recover to pre-pandemic levels.Earlier this week, BA boss Alex Cruz announced that up to a quarter of the airline's 42,000 staff would be laid off as the airline fights for survival.He had previously warned staff that coronavirus marks the biggest threat in the airline's history, worse than 9/11 or the SARS outbreakThe airline has informed the pilots' union Balpa that the cuts could include a quarter of the airline's plots.The letter, written on April 28, reads: 'In a short space of time the situation has significantly deteriorated.'In a separate announcement, the head of BA's Gatwick operations yesterday [THU] told staff it is possible that BA could suspend operations from the West Sussex hub, where it has had a presence since 1950.In normal times, around six million BA passengers a year fly to and from Gatwick to more than 60 destinations. The airport relies heavily on seasonal holiday traffic.Insiders say that BA is preparing to dramatically downsize as part of an extreme cost-cutting strategy. This could soon include the total suspension of the few BA flights that are continuing to run. It is also likely BA will pull operations from Terminal 3 at Heathrow. It is currently based at Terminal 5. The intervention follows mounting criticism over the Government's inaction on airport screening.Critics say the total lack of checks on passengers entering the UK makes a mockery of the lockdown and threatens the health of the nation.Ministers estimate around 15,000 people are arriving into the UK every day - including many from virus-ravaged countries such as Italy, Iran and China.There are no proper checks but passengers are handed leaflets about symptoms.Airport bosses are concerned the lack of screening measures makes our airports appear more dangerous than others, and could lead to plummeting passenger numbers when flying does resume.Last week, Mr Holland-Kaye revealed to the Mail that Heathrow has requested Public Health England (PHE) release scientific evidence proving their claims that temperature screening is 'ineffective'.PHE have long insisted that such measures are futile against a virus that has an incubation period of 14 days.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said the airport screening policy is 'under review', and could change in the future.The point was reiterated in a letter to all MPs from aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst earlier this week.Passenger travelling to Britain could face mandatory quarantining to control the spread of coronavirus, the Transport Secretary has said.Grant Shapps revealed he is 'actively looking at' beefed up border controls following weeks of criticism over a lack of screening at UK airports.It came as shocking pictures emerged showing packed flights, including a BA service from Heathrow to Barcelona and a Government-organised rescue flight from Turkey to Stansted.Travellers in facemasks described being crammed 'like sardines' on Wednesday's BA flight, and said the lack of distancing measures 'makes a complete mockery of the lockdown rules'.A passenger on the flight said: 'There was no requirement to wear masks but some did choose to do so. The cabin crew are not required to wear masks but some chose to do so. You will see there is no attempt at any kind of social distancing - everyone is sitting within inches of their fellow passengers.' EasyJet is considering stripping out middle seats to enable social distancing, although industry leaders fear this could make flights unprofitable and lead to higher air fares. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday, Mr Shapps said he is 'actively looking at' quarantine requirements for foreign visitors, mirroring similar schemes that have been in place for weeks in dozens of other countries.He said: 'I think it is important that as we are seeing the numbers decrease and the R rate we hope decrease... that we do ensure that the sacrifices in a sense - social distancing - that we are asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country.'I am actively looking at these issues right now so that when we have infection rates within the country under control we are not importing.'The uncertainty over the future of air travel is one of the main reasons why BA are warning of drastic cuts in the months to come.Bosses are planning to lay off a quarter of the airline's staff - up to 12,000 workers, including one in four pilots - and the airline may even suspend operations at Gatwick.Senior BA managers were due to be questioned on the crisis in a hearing before the Commons transport committee on Wednesday.MPs had hoped to grill Willie Walsh, the boss of BA's parent company IAG, on issues relating to redundancies and delays in issuing customer refunds.However, it emerged last night that Walsh has refused to attend and no other BA senior manager will take his place. Committee chair Huw Merriman MP accused the airline of 'seeking to avoid scrutiny'. IAG declined to comment.On the issue of crowded flights a spokesman for BA said: 'Like other forms of transport we are keeping vital links open - repatriating customers and ensuring key supplies like medicines and food are flown in.'We continue to follow all the guidance from the UK Government and global health authorities, including Public Health England and the World Health Organisation. We have taken several steps to reduce contact between customers and crew, and personal protective equipment is available to them.' Airlines UK, the trade body representing airlines,warned a 14-day quarantine requirement 'would effectively kill air travel'.Chief executive Tim Alderslade said it would 'completely shut off the UK from the rest of the world when other countries are opening up their economies'.  
Wellington, New Zealand (CNN) — It may be some time before tourists are traveling the globe again. But what if you could travel through designated, approved parts of it?Politicians from Australia and New Zealand are discussing the possibility of opening up borders to each other, creating a travel corridor -- or "travel bubble" -- between the two nations.Both countries almost completely shut their borders to foreigners in March, a huge blow to their respective tourism industries. But with both appearing to have successfully brought their coronavirus outbreaks under control, politicians are now talking about when borders could be opened to each other."If there is any country in the world with whom we can reconnect with first, undoubtedly that's New Zealand," Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last month."That is a situation we would all like to be in, but of course, our number one focus at the moment is making sure that both our countries are in the position where we're domestically managing Covid-19 to a point where we can with confidence open borders," New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on April 27."One thing I'm not willing to do is jeopardize the position that New Zealand has got itself into by moving too soon to open our borders -- even to Australia."It's not clear when this "bubble" could become a reality -- currently both countries still have domestic travel restrictions in place, and all international arrivals are subject to a 14-day quarantine.Travel industry experts say August is when the corridor is likely to be rolled out, possibly in time for the ski season in New Zealand and the school holidays in September.A special relationshipThere are a few reasons why New Zealand and Australia would be each other's first pick.Although the two countries are separated by about 2,000 km (1,243 miles) of sea, they have one of the closest bilateral relationships in the world. Australian passport holders can travel and work in New Zealand indefinitely without a visa, and vice versa.The two countries also contribute heavily to each other's tourism industry.Australians make up almost 40% of international arrivals to New Zealand, and around 24% of New Zealand's international visitor spend. That's especially significant in New Zealand, where tourism is the country's biggest export industry. (Tourism is considered an export industry because it involves foreign cash being used to buy New Zealand's goods and services.)Over in Australia, New Zealanders make up around 15% of the country's international visitors, and only about 6% of the international visitor spend. Tourism is still worth billions to Australia, although it is only the country's fourth biggest export industry.In both countries, tourism industries have taken a massive hit from the coronavirus outbreak -- so it's no surprise that industry representatives are welcoming the prospect of a travel bubble."The message from the industry side is that the bubble is a goer," said Simon Westaway, the executive director of the Australian Tourism Industry Council, adding that it was the only way of getting international tourism into Australia in the near future."If we can add in the Australians, that would be enormously beneficial for the survival of tourism businesses and thousands of jobs," said Chris Roberts, the chief executive of Tourism Industry Aotearoa, which represents the tourism industry in New Zealand. He added that the amount tourists spend in New Zealand had dropped by at least 2 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.22 billion) a month.But Roberts isn't expecting the levels of Australian tourists that New Zealand had pre-Covid -- he thinks many would opt to just travel domestically.In Australia, some tour operators had been focusing their attention on China, which makes up about 15% of travelers to Australia but 27% of total tourist spend. Westaway said those businesses would need to adapt and work out how to appeal to more Kiwi travelers.How would it work?One thing to keep in mind: Australia is made up of states and territories, and some of those currently have additional quarantine rules in place. For instance, a person traveling from Sydney (in New South Wales) to Brisbane (in Queensland) would need to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine period.Airports may also need to roll out new procedures.Roberts envisions a future where tourists may turn up to the airport, be tested for Covid-19 and only be allowed on the plane once they've got a negative result. Once they are at their destination, they may have their temperature checked. Travelers may need to supply more information than usual so they can be easily traced, if necessary.Both Roberts and Westaway believe the bubble would only work if the current 14-day quarantine period for anyone entering the country is removed.Once the trans-Tasman bubble is tried and tested, New Zealand could look to include other territories in its bubble -- perhaps Taiwan and Hong Kong, Roberts said."I think it will be on a country by country basis," he said. "A general opening of borders could be a very long time away."Could the bubble get bigger?There's also some discussion about broadening the bubble to include the Pacific Islands.From a health perspective, the Pacific Island nations appear to have escaped the coronavirus outbreak largely unscathed. Fiji -- the worst affected Pacific Island nation -- has reported only 18 coronavirus cases and no deaths. Guam -- which is a US territory and not a nation -- has reported more than 140 coronavirus cases and five deaths.Many Pacific Island nations closed borders early to protect against potential spread.But the pandemic has hurt tourism to the Pacific Islands, one of the most aid-dependent regions in the world.Ardern has urged caution on including the Pacific, saying: "Our Pacific neighbors in large part have not been afflicted by Covid-19, and the last thing we would want is to risk that."But broadening Australia and New Zealand's travel bubble to at least some Pacific Islands would help boost the islands' tourism industry, said Stephen Howes, the director of the Development Policy Center at Australian National University in Canberra."For a lot of people, it's very tough," he said of the effect on tourism in the Pacific. "Some have gone back to their village ... people are just struggling to get by.""Obviously no country would be forced to do this," he said, adding that the travel corridor could always be stopped if it didn't work. "It would be a complex undertaking ... but it's certainly worth trying."And including the Pacific would also help Australia and New Zealand, allowing migrant workers to enter both countries. The inclusion could also have a huge soft power impact in the region, which is of strategic importance to New Zealand, Australia and China."This is a real test," Howes said. "If Australia and New Zealand go ahead and just have a trans-Tasman partnership, they could really antagonize the Pacific. It would be like, 'well you don't really care.'"Roberts agreed that the bubble would benefit the Pacific, saying that without tourism, their economies are in significant trouble."In terms of economic aid to our Pacific neighbors, that would be the best thing we could do for them -- as long as we could do it safely."Is this the future of travel?A potential Australia and New Zealand travel bubble may end up being a model for the rest of the world, Roberts and Westaway say.Like other countries around the world, New Zealand and Australia will need to be careful not to move too fast and create a second Covid-19 wave.Moving too fast could also jeopardize their image with international tourists, who view the countries as clean, trustworthy places.But generally, Roberts and Westaway are hopeful."If (the detail) can be worked out between New Zealand and Australia, then they can be applied to other places as well," Roberts said."There's quite a lot of attention paid to this part of the world now because of the apparent success of New Zealand and Australia containing the virus outbreak. If we can also then come up with a way to resume travel between countries, I'm sure the rest of the world will be taking a very keen interest to see how that works."
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, facing a growing swell of allegations that he has made women uncomfortable with his use of physical contact, made light of the controversy on Friday while continuing to lay the groundwork for a 2020 presidential run.Speaking to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Washington, Biden joked that he “had permission” to hug the union’s male president, Lonnie Stephenson.The welcoming, mostly male audience responded with laughter and cheers.Biden made a similar joke again after inviting some children of the attendees on stage and draping his arm around a boy.Biden’s remarks were his first public comments since more than a half-dozen women aired their complaints that he had touched them inappropriately at political events.In spite of the jokes, Biden told reporters after the event he is taking the complaints about his personal conduct seriously. But he stopped short of apologising.“The fact of the matter is I’ve made it clear that if I made anyone feel uncomfortable I feel badly about that,” he said. “It was never my intention, ever, ever, ever.“I’m sorry I didn’t understand more. I’m not sorry for any of my intentions. I’m not sorry for anything that I have ever done - I’ve never been disrespectful intentionally, to a man or a woman.”He pledged the concerns would change how he campaigns should he run for president. Biden, who served eight years as vice president under President Donald Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, and decades as a U.S. senator, is expected to announce his plans later this month.Sources close to Biden told Reuters this week that the flap over his history of hugging and touching members of the public at political events has not deterred an expected White House bid.Biden’s remarks on Friday were similar to those he offered in a video he released earlier this week on social media, in which he acknowledged that concepts of “personal space” had changed in the context of the #MeToo movement.The enduring controversy underscores the challenge the 76-year-old career politician faces should he run.While Biden consistently sits atop public opinion polls assessing the 2020 Democratic field, some in the party have said he is out of step with its more progressive, diverse and younger elements.His travails have been noticed by Trump, who on Thursday retweeted a doctored version of Biden’s video response to the accusations.On Friday, Trump told reporters Biden is “going through a situation” and said he doesn’t regard him as a political threat.“I think he’s only a threat to himself,” Trump said at the White House before departing on a trip to California.During his speech to the electrical workers union, Biden largely stuck to what is expected to be a persistent theme of his presidential campaign: the vitality of the nation’s middle class.“This country was not built by Wall Street banks, and CEOs and hedge fund managers,” he said. “It was built by the great American middle class.”He criticized Trump, arguing the president undermines the country’s core values and is obsessed with settling personal scores.And, highlighting the tension between Biden and other forces within the Democratic Party, he again complained about attacks from “the far left” over his pledge to work with Republicans should he be elected president.“How do you get something done?” he wondered aloud.
US President Donald Trump has predicted 100,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the country and a vaccine to be ready by the end of the year, contradicting experts who said a cure is likely 18 months away.Trump relaunched his election campaign on Sunday, forecasting an "incredible" future as he alternated during a two-hour Fox News broadcast between predicting a rapid recovery for the US economy and casting blame for the pandemic's spread on China, where the disease is believed to have originated.COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, has infected more than 1.1 million and killed more than 67,000 in the United States, shut wide swaths of society, including most schools and many businesses."We're going to lose anywhere from 75, 80 to a 100,000 people. That's a horrible thing," said Trump.As recently as Friday, he had said he hoped fewer than 100,000 Americans would die and earlier in the week had talked about 60,000 to 70,000 deaths.Trump faced few tough questions in the event, which gave him a new format to reach the public [Joshua Roberts/Reuters]About half of the states in the US have now moved towards at least partial lifting of lockdowns as the number of new cases started to drop or level off and as citizens agitate for relief from restrictions that have sent the economy into a tailspin."We can't stay closed as a country [or] we're not gonna have a country left," Trump said.Few tough questionsThe US president faced a few tough questions in the event, which gave him a new format to reach the public while he is unable to hold campaign rallies and after he faced widespread criticism for his combative daily briefings.In an assessment that clashes with those of some public health experts, Trump said he believed that there would be a vaccine for COVID-19 by the end of the year."The doctors would say, well, you shouldn't say that," Trump said. "I'll say what I think ... I think we'll have a vaccine sooner than later."Many health experts, including Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, have cautioned that a vaccine is likely a year to 18 months away.There is an "incredibly small" chance of having a highly effective vaccine or treatment for the coronavirus within the next year, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on April 22.Trump also said he wanted students to return to schools and colleges in autumn (in the months of September to December in the US), even as he acknowledged the possibility of a resurgence of the disease."We'll put out the embers, we'll put out whatever it may be. We may have to put out a fire," he said.Speaking the day before the Senate returns to Washington, DC, Trump said it was possible that federal coronavirus aid could rise to $6 trillion from the nearly $3 trillion Congress has already passed to try to ease the heavy economic toll of the crisis."There is more help coming. There has to be," he said.Meanwhile, Trump, who has been criticised for not moving faster early in the year to stop the spread of the disease, sought to blunt criticism by blaming China.He said China made a "horrible mistake" without saying precisely what this was or providing specific evidence for his assertion. Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was "a significant amount of evidence" that COVID-19 emerged from a Chinese laboratory, but did not dispute US intelligence agencies' conclusion that it was not man-made. 
While hiring in the U.S. rebounded in March, baby boomers who are still in the work force are not doing so great.Employment for people age 55 and older dropped 209,000 last month, the biggest such decline since February 2015 when 251,000 jobs were cut for the age group, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.While the decline was notable, a one-month change hardly makes a trend. In fact, this age group still has the lowest unemployment level among all cohorts, with a 2.7% jobless rate in March unchanged from February. The overall unemployment rate held steady at 3.8% in March.“This data tends to be volatile monthly. I don’t think it’s a start of a trend,” said Craig Dismuke, chief economist at Vining Sparks. “Broadly speaking, I think the labor market has been very good for people over the age of 55 and 65.”Month-to-month swings can appear large because of the small sample size of the population survey, ZipRecruiter’s labor economist Julia Pollak told CNBC.“The Current Population Survey is a survey of about 60,000 households, and the sample sizes get small when one slices the data by age group and employment status. But the overall trends appear positive,” Pollak said.Although the number can be volatile, several industries including government and educational services where the employment distribution skews toward older workers have seen “sluggish” growth lately, Pollak pointed out.Baby boomers have been the biggest job gainers in the last decade. Many of them facing retirement tend to stay in the workforce partly because they fear they don’t have enough money saved up. President Donald Trump has also pushed for policies to encourage more Americans to get back to work as baby boomers retire.“The broader trend is that the participation in 55 and over continue to rise,” Dismuke said. “I do think there’s an issue that people haven’t saved enough and they are forced to work longer. We have a smaller percentage of our jobs today [that] are manually taxing like they would’ve been 40 years ago,” and less physically demanding work allows people to work longer, Dismuke said.
The Trump administration has offered to scrap its next round of tariffs on Chinese goods set to take effect Sunday and slash some existing duties in half, two sources told CNBC.The development signals the White House’s willingness to rein in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that threatens to drag on global growth. The U.S. proposed cutting existing tariffs on $360 billion in Chinese products by 50%.The White House offer to Beijing, first reported in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, came last week and may have changed. Recent talks have taken place mostly at the deputy level.Hours before a meeting with his top economic advisors Thursday about whether to cancel the upcoming tariffs, President Donald Trump signaled more optimism about an agreement with China. He tweeted that the U.S. has moved close to a trade deal with Beijing after several false starts and near misses.“Getting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China. They want it, and so do we!” the president wrote.Trump’s acknowledgement that the U.S. wants a deal marks a shift in tone from recent weeks. He has repeatedly contended that Beijing needs an agreement more than Washington does, and suggested he was content waiting until after the November 2020 election to strike a deal.Duties of 15% on about $160 billion in consumer goods are set to take effect on Sunday, including on Chinese-made toys, computers, phones and clothing. The president’s meeting with advisors about the tariffs was set for 2:30 p.m. ET, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.Major U.S. stock indexes jumped following Trump’s tweet. Investors hope the U.S. and China can reach an accord before the tariff deadline and avoid a potentially damaging escalation in their nearly 2-year-old trade war.Trump in October announced a partial “phase one” agreement with China as the world’s two largest economies try to rein in the economic conflict. Washington and Beijing have so far failed to sign the agreement, which would have involved increased Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural products and possible tariff relief.During months of trade talks with China, the president has previously touted progress before discussions crumbled. He has repeatedly said the negotiations are going well, even as trade officials struggled to reach a deal.The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative did not immediately respond to a request to comment.Trump wants a broad trade agreement with China to address concerns about intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers and trade deficits. The president, who promised to crack down with China during his 2016 campaign, sees an agreement as an economic and political priority ahead of his 2020 reelection bid.Not all of Trump’s advisors want to back off the planned duties. China hawk Peter Navarro, under the pseudonym “Ron Vara,” wrote a memo supporting the White House’s tariff strategy.In the document obtained by CNBC on Wednesday, he wrote that tariffs “are working to defend [the] economy and have had no negative impacts on growth or stock market rise.”
SEOUL, South Korea -- Cheerleaders danced beneath rows of empty seats, and umpires wore protective masks as a new Korea Baseball Organization season began in South Korea.After a weekslong delay because of the coronavirus pandemic, a hushed atmosphere allowed sounds, such as the ball hitting the catcher's mitt and the bat hitting the ball for a single or double, to echo around the stadium.There were faces in the stands at a game on Tuesday -- pictures placed in the seating -- because fans aren't allowed into the venues for now.As a result, it was easy to hear players cheering and shouting from the dugouts. It was a relief to fans watching from home in a country that is now attempting a slow return to pre-COVID-19 normalcy amid a waning caseload.The country's professional soccer leagues will kick off Friday, also without spectators in the stadiums.As one of the world's first major professional sports competitions to return to action amid the pandemic, the KBO League has employed preventive measures aimed at creating safe playing environments.Players and coaches go through fever screenings before entering stadiums, and umpires and first- and third-base coaches must wear masks during games. Players are prohibited from high-fiving teammates or signing autographs. Chewing tobacco was banned to prevent spitting. Masks and latex gloves are required at training facilities.Fans will be barred from games until the KBO is convinced that the risks of infection have been minimized. If any member of a team tests positive for the coronavirus at any point of the season, the league will be shut down for at least three weeks.On Tuesday, teams tried to create a festive atmosphere in the empty stadiums.In a game in the capital, Seoul-based LG Twins defeated crosstown rival and defending champion Doosan Bears 8-2 at Jamsil Baseball Stadium, where the outfield seats were decked with huge banners of the Twins' cheering slogans.Twins outfielder Kim Hyun-soo, who spent some time with the Baltimore Orioles, hit the league's first home run of the season in the third inning, a two-run shot off Bears starter Raul Alcantara. As he rounded the bases, Kim extended a hand toward third-base coach Kim Jea-gul, who raised his arm but stayed out of contact."The players just really wanted to play baseball, and we are delighted to do just that," Kim Hyun-soo said.In Incheon, SK Wyverns imitated a home crowd by covering the outfield seats with rows of horizontal banners showing faces of fans wearing Wyverns caps and masks as they hosted the Daejeon-based Hanwha Eagles.In Daegu, the city hit the worst by the virus, the home team Samsung Lions used their huge scoreboard to play video messages from players, celebrities and fans thanking doctors and medical staff fighting the outbreak, which overwhelmed the city's hospital capacities in late February and March before slowing in recent weeks. The Lions' game against the Changwon-based NC Dinos was broadcast on ESPN. The NC Dinos won 4-0."It would have been better if they could be with us, but I am glad that we delivered something good to fans watching TV," said Dinos outfielder Na Sung-bum, who went 2-for-3.Also, the Seoul-based Kiwoom Heroes routed the host Kia Tigers 11-2 in Gwangju, handing former San Francisco Giants slugger Matt Williams his first loss as a manager in the KBO. The Busan-based Lotte Giants defeated the KT Wiz 7-2 on the road in Suwon.A full season of baseball seemed doubtful in early March, when South Korea was reporting around 500 new coronavirus cases per day, forcing the KBO to postpone its March 28 season openers.But South Korea reported just three new cases on Tuesday, its lowest daily jump since infections surged in late February. Experts credit the downward trend to tightened border controls and active efforts to test and isolate virus carriers and trace their contacts, using medical, banking and immigration records and location information provided by police and telecommunications companies.Officials have started relaxing social-distancing guidelines and are preparing to reopen schools, starting with high school seniors on May 13.Barring any virus-related suspensions, the KBO plans to maintain a 144-game regular-season schedule. However, it decided to scrap its all-star game and shorten the first round of the playoffs from best-of-five to best-of-three series.  
New York City will distribute 7.5 million free cloth and non-medical face coverings immediately to further prevent the spread of Covid-19, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Monday. New Yorkers have overwhelmingly complied with Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive order requiring all residents to wear face coverings when in public, de Blasio said at his daily press briefing. To further comply with the order and prevent the spread of the virus, the city will distribute 5 million three-ply non-medical masks and 2.5 million cloth face coverings citywide, including at grocery stores, parks, meal sites and other city locations. “Wherever you turn, you’re going to be offered a face covering, and it’s going to be on an ongoing basis for weeks to come to make sure everyone has what they need,” de Blasio said. The face coverings will not be the same as the city’s health-care workers use but are still effective as long as they remain dry, de Blasio said. He added that for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak in March, the city will have enough personal protective equipment this upcoming week for its hospitals. De Blasio also said he is sending more than 1.9 million surgical masks to nursing homes across the five boroughs. “We can finally ensure for the whole week ahead that every hospital and every nursing home will get what they need,” de Blasio said. All three indicators the city uses to track the spread of Covid-19 were down on Monday, de Blasio said. The daily number of people admitted to the hospital for suspected Covid-19 dipped below 100, and the number of people currently in New York City Health and Hospitals’ intensive care stood at 632, down from 645 people as of May 1, he said. Approximately 17% of people citywide tested positive for Covid-19, down from 20%. “This is the kind of day we had been waiting for, and it’s a beautiful thing. Let’s put together some more like it, and that’s our pathway to something better,” de Blasio said. The city has been conducting about 13,000 tests per day, which is “definitely progress” compared with weeks prior, de Blasio said. While there are still a “substantial number of new cases each day,” he said that the city is starting to see the numbers decline as testing capacity increases. “I think it means the strategies are working, that we’re going to stick to them, and that we’re only going to let up very carefully and in a very steady fashion to not allow that resurgence or that boomerang,” de Blasio said.  
San Francisco has turned into something akin to a nightmare. Its homeless population has risen to nearly 10,000 residents, its rents have climbed to nearly $1,900 per month, and parts of its downtown are now littered with used needles, trash, and human poop.As more tech workers flock to the city for jobs at Google, Facebook, and Uber, longtime creative professionals like artists and musicians have found it increasingly difficult to live there. The next decade will be a defining period in the city's history, Alicia John-Baptiste, the president of SPUR — a research organization that develops solutions to major problems in the Bay Area — told Business Insider. Those ten years could determine whether San Francisco is able to accommodate its low-income residents or if it transforms into a city that only the wealthy few can afford.Here are some ways to improve the city before it's too late.San Francisco has laws that restrict where affordable housing can be built. Those need to go.Research from the nonprofit organization Next 10 indicates that San Francisco needs to build 200,000 units of housing each year to keep up with its population growth. But there's a reason why the city has only allowed 113,000 units to be built since 2017.San Francisco is governed by zoning regulations that determine how certain areas of land can be used. These laws originated as a way to segregate white, wealthy communities from poor residents of color.Many of San Francisco's zoning regulations favor single-family units, which means that developments can accommodate fewer people. Single-family zones also tend to be more expensive, creating large pockets of wealth throughout the city.To make San Francisco more affordable, the city will need to alter its zoning laws to allow more affordable and multifamily units to be built in residential neighborhoods.The city should limit the construction of luxury apartments and short-term rentals.Investors frequently buy units in San Francisco and flip them into short-term rentals on services like HomeAway and Airbnb. At the same time, the world's wealthy billionaires are scooping up luxury apartments throughout the city, creating a demand for high-end real estate.By cracking down of the construction of luxury apartments, and limiting the amount of short-term rentals that are allowed in the city, San Francisco could free up more space for affordable housing."The region overall has really struggled to grow gracefully over the past 20 years or so," John-Baptiste said. "We now have the question of how we grow within the existing fabric of the city."The state can protect vulnerable tenants so they aren't easily evicted.San Francisco's average rent climbed 18% in the last five years, making it more difficult for low-income residents to afford their monthly rental payments. Residents who fail to pay their rent run the risk of eviction, which can make it harder for them to secure a rental property in the future. In some cases, it can even drive residents into homelessness. Last year, 15% of San Franciscans reported to the city that they had been threatened with evictions in the previous five years. Nearly half of these residents came from households earning less than 50% of the city's median income.John-Baptiste said protecting these residents should go "hand in hand" with increasing the city's housing supply. To save residents from eviction or displacement, Marsha Cohen, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings, has suggested a state-wide program that subsidizes rents for low-income families in California. The entire Bay Area could help with lowering transit costs.San Francisco's main transit system, BART, has gotten steadily more expensive since 2013, when its board of directors approved a series of fare hikes that expire in 2020. Another set of fare hikes is scheduled to go into effect in 2022.Bringing these costs down will be critical to making the city more affordable for residents. But John-Baptiste said that San Francisco shouldn't bear this burden alone."When we ask cities to solve problems on their own, we're sometimes trying to solve things at the wrong scale," John-Baptiste said. All nine counties in Bay Area, she said, should consider coordinating their investments in a regional transit network.Tax large corporations and businesses can pay for the services that people need — like street cleaning.On a recent visit to San Francisco, President Donald Trump said the city was in "total violation" of environmental regulations because of its homelessness crisis, which has left some blocks littered with feces and discarded needles. "The allegations that Trump was levying were false," John-Baptiste said. "But I understand the concern that residents have relative to street cleanliness."One way to start paying for services that people need, she said, is to rethink Proposition 13 — a constitutional amendment that decreased property taxes in California. Democratic lawmakers have suggested revising the proposition to boost taxes for large corporations and businesses. The tax revenue could then be used to find city services like transit, street cleaning, or low-income housing.San Francisco voters have already passed a measure to tax the city's largest corporations to fund services for the homeless, but it could be years before the city is able to collect the funds.Build affordable homes in places that are safe from wildfires.San Francisco's housing crunch has forced residents to relocate to more affordable suburbs and rural areas outside the city center. In some cases, these areas are located in the wildland-urban interface — a place where housing development is either close to or located within wildfire territory.Between 1990 and 2010, about half of the housing units built in California were constructed in this potentially dangerous zone."While forest fires have always happened, [people] have impinged into areas that are prone to fire," Marko Bourne, a former Federal Emergency Management Agency official, told Business Insider. "Now we're being impacted by those fires directly."John-Baptiste said there's a strong need for affordable housing in places that are safe from climate-related hazards. Don't incentivize construction in areas that are vulnerable to sea-level rise.As low-income residents relocate to wildfire territory outside the urban core, San Francisco's high-income residents have gravitated toward luxury waterfront developments. For the last several years, developers have been building an $8 billion neighborhood at the city's Hunters Point Shipyard, located directly along the San Francisco Bay. Condos there were priced up to $1.5 million as of last year. Developers are also planning a $1.5 billion project to build 8,000 residential units on Treasure Island, an artificial land mass that sits squarely in the bay.Both of these new developments are vulnerable to sea-level rise. A March 2018 study from the American Association for the Advancement of Science predicts that up to 166 square miles of the Bay Area could be underwater by 2100. John-Baptiste said the city could instate zoning regulations that prohibit developers from building in areas that are at high risk of flooding. Another option would be to incentivize building away from the coast. Whatever the city decides, she added, it will have to act quickly."It is time for us to become far more ambitious in what we believe we can achieve," John-Baptiste said. "We're going to have to figure out ways to do the big fixes much faster than we've been able to in the past."
A special envoy to the World Health Organization on the coronavirus said in an interview Sunday that the global economy may have to assume that there will not be a vaccine and consider ways to approach the virus a “constant threat."Dr. David Nabarro, a professor of global health at Imperial College London, told CNN that societies need to get into the position where they can defend against it while getting on with daily lives. He pointed out that some viruses do not have a vaccine. The report pointed out that some vaccines are in the trial stage and some experts are optimistic due to the fact that COVID-19 is not known to mutate at a fast rate.“There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against,” he told CNN. “We can’t make an absolute assumption that a vaccine all appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.”The Center for Infectious Disease Research at the University of Minnesota recently suggested that COVID-19 will linger for the next two years and countries should be prepared for “periodic” outbreaks. The report said containment will be so challenging due, in part, to the fact that so many of those infected are asymptomatic, according to Bloomberg.It has been widely reported that without a proven treatment, vaccine or cure, governments will have to limit social interaction. The coronavirus is considered highly contagious and most dangerous for the elderly population and those with comorbidities. Health officials in the U.S. believe that shelter-in-place orders contributed to a lower-than-expected infection rate.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a coronavirus press briefing earlier last month that the world may never return to the “normal” that was known before the outbreak."When we get back to normal, we will go back to the point where we can function as a society,” he said.  He continued, “If you want to get back to pre-coronavirus, that might not ever happen in the sense that the threat is there."
Spotify  is officially rolling out its redesigned experience, which puts a greater emphasis on podcasts. The company today announced a new version of its “Your Library” section is being rolled out now to paying subscribers on its Premium plan. Its goal is to make it easier to move between Music and Podcasts and find the podcast shows and episodes you want to hear.The company in May previewed this news with select press while the redesign was in testing.With the update, users will be able to swipe or tap to switch between music and podcasts, while the latter also features three sections for podcast management: Episodes, Downloads and Shows.The Episodes tab lets you seek new episodes or resume the podcasts you’re already listening to, picking up where you left off. As you scroll down, you’ll find other newly released episodes from the shows you follow. In other words, the experience prioritizes your in-progress episodes over a strict chronological order.The Downloads tab is where you can manage the episodes you’ve saved for offline listening and the Shows tab is where you can manage the podcasts you follow and check out their prior episodes. The shows are ranked in this section by whichever ones have the newest episodes.Meanwhile, the Music tab has been updated to make it easier to get to the content you want to access. Where before users were presented with a list (Playlists, Stations, Songs, Albums, etc.) to dive into, you’ll now be dropped directly into the Playlist section.To get to the Artists or Albums, you swipe or tap to reach their section. To add an Artist, you still “follow” them as before, and albums you favorite (by tapping the heart) are saved to the Albums section. You can also save all of an album’s songs to your “Liked Songs” playlist by tapping the three-dot more menu (…) then choosing “Like all songs.”The redesign places far less emphasis on video content, an earlier focus for the streaming music provider. This year, Spotify has instead doubled down on podcasts, believing in its ability to shift radio advertising over to its app by offering better targeting.It’s been selling its own ads on its original podcasts since mid-2018. However, paid subscriptions still account for the bulk of Spotify’s revenue today — €1,385 million versus just €126 million from advertising in Q1, and subscriptions are growing faster than advertising at 34% versus 24%, respectively.The company has been ramping up on podcasts across the board, with acquisitions in the market like Gimlet, Parcast and Anchor as well as investments in original programming and exclusives. Just yesterday, Spotify announced a new personalized playlist that combines music and podcasts.Beyond its podcast focus, Spotify’s redesigned app is much easier to navigate — addressing a concern that some have had with the overall experience. Spotify’s busy interface is often cited by those who opt for Apple Music as one of the reasons they prefer the competitor’s app. To some extent, this is personal preference. But arguably, Spotify has been overdue for an update given its shifting attention.Spotify says the updated design is live today for Premium users worldwide. It’s already been available to free users.
(CNN)A Florida sheriff appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis after the Parkland school shooting is defending himself after admitting he fatally shot a man when he was 14 years old.Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony said in a statement Monday he "shot an armed man in self-defense" during his time growing up in a Philadelphia neighborhood "filled with violence and gang activity."News of Tony's involvement in the 1993 shooting came to light when the online news organization Florida Bulldog reported the incident on Saturday after interviewing the family of 18-year-old Hector "Chino" Rodriguez, the man he killed."This was the most difficult and painful experience of my life and I have never spoken of it publicly. I worked every day from that time forward to leave the violence that surrounded me in Philadelphia behind," Tony said in his statement to CNN."Surviving this assault inspired me to do work to help others. The world is filled with violent individuals and brave men and women who protect the innocent against their actions. This is the essence of law enforcement and is why I have dedicated my life to service in law enforcement."Tony was initially charged as an adult, but his case was transferred to juvenile court, where a judge found him not guilty and sealed his records, the Florida Bulldog reported.Tony eventually left Philadelphia and moved to Florida to play football at Florida State University, where he graduated with a degree in criminology.His career in law enforcement began when he joined the Coral Springs Police Department SWAT team in 2005.Tony did not mention the shooting when he applied to become a law enforcement officer in Coral Springs or when DeSantis appointed him as sheriff, according to the Florida Bulldog.Tony told the Tampa Bay Times he has no regrets about not disclosing the shooting because he was never arrested."Under Pennsylvania law, they looked at this thing and found no just cause for any type of crime," he added.After the Pennsylvania juvenile justice system reviewed the incident, it was "concluded there was no crime and cleared (Tony's) name," a spokesperson for the Broward County Sheriff's Office told CNN.Becoming the Broward County sheriffDeSantis appointed Tony to replace Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, who the governor suspended for failing "in his duties to keep our families and children safe" during the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 14 students and three teachers dead.Tony, who was appointed in January 2019, became the first black sheriff in Broward County's history."It's not like he's my sheriff. I didn't even know the guy. It's not like he was a political ally of mine," DeSantis said during a press conference Monday,"The people I talked to in Broward have been pleased with what he's doing. That's ultimately a decision that the people in Broward can make. It's not going to be anything I'm going to be getting involved in."A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement told CNN before his appointment as sheriff, they completed a level 1 background check on Tony.The agency included a court query with their request and found no court records in Pennsylvania. The FDLE also conducted a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) check and found no sealed records.When asked if Tony was obligated to disclose his involvement in the shooting, the spokesperson said they could not answer that question.The governor said one of the reasons he appointed Tony was because he liked that the sheriff "had come from real tough upbringing" and was a great officer.Tony is running against Israel in a heated race for the 2020 election of the next Broward sheriff. Both candidates have received no-confidence votes from their deputies. 
With just less than a year until U.S. Election Day, Twitter  is bringing back its Election Labels, which provide information about political candidates — including which office they’re running for and their state and district number. The labels will also have a small ballot box icon to accompany this information. The feature was first launched during the 2018 U.S. midterms, where the labels were seen 100 million times per day by Twitter users in the week before Election Day.In addition, 13% of U.S. election-related conversations on Twitter included a tweet with an Election Label, the company says.Now the labels are making a return ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections.The labels will appear on accounts of candidates who are running for the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Senate or Governor in the 2020 election who have qualified for the general election ballot, says Twitter. And they will begin to appear on candidates’ Twitter accounts after they qualify, which will happen on a rolling basis as states have different caucus and election dates, the company notes. The first takes place on March 3.To enable the feature, Twitter has again partnered with Ballotpedia, a civic nonprofit that publishes non-partisan information about federal, state and local politics. The organization will help Twitter identify which candidates have qualified for the general election ballot so their accounts can be appropriately labeled.The Election Label will appear on the profile page of a candidate’s Twitter account and on every tweet and retweet they post to their account, even when embedded on sites off of Twitter.Ahead of this, Twitter today will also start to verify the campaign Twitter accounts of those who have qualified for primary elections for the U.S. House, Senate or Governor. This is different from how Twitter handled candidate verification during the 2018 midterms. Back then, it only verified candidates after they qualified for the general election ballot. This time around, Twitter says it will proactively verify the primary candidates.This verification is the same checkmark other high-profile accounts receive — like those belonging to celebrities or other public figures. These verifications will start today and will continue on a rolling basis as states have different filing deadlines. Ballotpedia is also assisting on this effort as well, by helping Twitter identify the candidates.Twitter, like other social platforms, was heavily impacted by foreign interference with the U.S. 2016 presidential election. Last year, Twitter said that 1.4 million people interacted with Russian trolls during the presidential campaign, which is more than double the 677,775 that Twitter originally believed had either seen, followed or retweeted one of those accounts. These interference issues have been ongoing, as thousands of Twitter accounts spreading false information remained active in the weeks ahead of the U.S. midterms.Bots continue today to infect the platform in an effort to sway public opinion. For example, in April, Twitter removed more than 5,000 bots with ties to a social media operation that previously promoted messages sympathetic to Saudi Arabia’s government. The bots had more recently been promoting the “Russiagate” hoax.Disinformation efforts like this are not just impacting social platforms in the U.S., nor are they only associated with Russian bots. In a report released at the beginning of 2019, Twitter said it had banned more than 4,000 disinformation accounts originating in Russia, 3,300 from Iran and more than 750 from Venezuela.When Twitter first introduced the Election Labels for the U.S. midterms, it stressedhow important it is for people using its platform to be able to identify the original sources and authentic information.Today, Twitter’s system to label and verify politicians and candidates’ campaigns is now a part of a number of efforts Twitter has underway to make sure conversations taking place on its platform are authentic. The company says it will later release more tools to help better find quality news and have more informative conversations on Twitter.
The second meteor shower in as many weeks will dazzle the eyes of stargazers around the globe, but the light show will be battling against the glow of a nearly full moon when it reaches its peak.The Eta Aquarids is an annual meteor shower in early May, and this year, it reached its climax on Monday night and the pre-dawn hours of Tuesday morning.“This shower happens to be one of if not the best in the Southern Hemisphere,” AccuWeather Astronomy Blogger Dave Samuhel said. “It is a moderate shower for the Northern Hemisphere.”People living south of the equator may count as many as 40 shooting stars per hour at the height of the celestial light show, the American Meteor Society (AMS) said. This includes Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America.“From the equator northward, they usually only produce medium rates of 10-30 per hour just before dawn,” the AMS added.This year, the meteor shower peaked just two nights before the final supermoon of 2020. The bright moon may make it difficult to see some of the fainter meteors, but it should not completely wash out the shower.Of course, weather and cloud cover will significantly factor into how well sky gazers in different parts of the country are able to witness the meteor shower Monday and Tuesday night.Onlookers across the southern U.S. and the interior West had the best viewing conditions on Monday night for 2020’s iteration of the Eta Aquarids.The Eta Aquarids will continue to be active on Tuesday night, providing onlookers with another opportunity to see the celestial light show.Clouds are forecast to become more widespread over the eastern and western U.S., but mainly clear conditions are expected to remain over the Four Corners and southern Plains. Northern New England and most of Florida should also have favorable viewing conditions on Tuesday night.There won't be another major meteor shower until the Delta Aquarids peak in late July.Tips for viewing the Eta AquaridsNo special equipment is needed to watch a meteor shower, although people should pack some patience when heading out to spend some time under the stars.“Give yourself a solid hour to look for meteors. Get comfortable. Lay down on a blanket, or a reclining chair,” Samuhel said.People should also avoid looking toward the moon, which will be above the horizon for most of the night. Looking at the moon can make it harder to see meteors, so try to focus in the darkest part of the sky.The best time to watch the meteor shower will be after midnight once the shower’s radiant point climbs above the horizon.The radiant point is simply the part of the sky where the meteors originate, but you do not need to look in this direction to spot meteors. However, as the radiant point climbs higher in the sky, more and more meteors will able to be seen.Shooting stars from Halley's CometMany of the meteor showers throughout the year are caused by debris left behind by comets when they visit the inner solar system. When this debris enters the Earth’s atmosphere, it burns incredibly bright for a few brief seconds.“The majority of visible meteors are caused by particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams,” the AMS said.The debris that causes the Eta Aquarids is actually dust left behind by one of the most famous comets — Halley’s Comet.Halley’s Comet only orbits the sun once every 75 years, but each year in early May, the Earth passes through some of the debris that it left behind.“The Eta Aquarids are one of two meteor showers sparked by Halley's comet. The other being the Orionids in October. “ People that miss out on the Eta Aquarids will need to wait a few months before the next opportunity to catch a meteor shower.According to the AMS, the next major meteor shower will not peak until late July. 
Today at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin, Samsung Electronic’s President Young Sohn revealed the company had sold 1 million foldable Galaxy Fold smartphones. Estimates from October pegged sales at that time at 500,000 units.“And I think that the point is, we’re selling [a] million of these products,” Sohn said. “There’s a million people that want to use this product at $2,000.”Today’s conversation at Disrupt Berlin focused around growth through innovation. Sohn commented on the sales number while explaining Samsung’s process of releasing products to get feedback. He said, in part, if they kept devices like the Fold in labs, they wouldn’t get the input they needed.And Samsung got a lot of feedback about the Galaxy Fold.The foldable phone was first announced early this year at MWC 2019, where it was among a handful of foldable devices. It launched several months later in April, where reviewers quickly discovered multiple problems, including screens that cracked. The company soon (though perhaps not quickly enough) reworked the product, re-releasing it in late September.The re-released Galaxy Fold was more durable, though our review unit still had screen issues.Today at Disrupt Berlin, I asked if Samsung is comfortable selling a $2,000 device that is essentially a beta device. He said yes, and pointed to the new sales number as justification.Previous media reports stated Samsung is ramping up plans to sell 6 million foldable devices in 2020.
Two powerful winter storms hammered the West Coast and Midwest on Wednesday, shutting down highways and snarling travel plans on one of the nation's busiest travel days.Weather watches, warnings and alerts were posted across much of the western half of the nation after a storm that had been a "bomb cyclone" marched westward from the California coast, AccuWeather reported.Hundreds of stranded cars were removed from Interstate 5 headed north from California into Oregon in the aftermath of the storm that dumped snow and created whiteout conditions on both sides of the California-Oregon border.As the skies cleared Wednesday, drivers reported being stuck for 17 or more hours in blizzard conditions and some spent the night in their vehicles.Farther south, winter storm warnings were in effect for the mountains near Los Angeles into early Friday with 6 to 12 inches of snow forecast for most mountains, except 12 to 24 inches for the San Gabriels, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned."Expect significant travel delays and road closures with dangerous winter driving conditions," the weather service said.Meanwhile, parts of the central U.S. remained under siege from a storm that delayed or canceled almost 1,000 flights in Denver alone. High winds and heavy snow forced a temporary shutdown of I-70 in parts of Colorado and across the border into Kansas. It reopened in Kansas, but the state Highway Patrol urged Kansans to stay off the roads."Stay put, doesn’t look like fun," Trooper Tod Hileman warned.As of Wednesday evening, howling winds had already knocked out power to over 220,000 customers in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions, according to poweroutage.us. This included 18,000 in the Chicago metro area, where high winds knocked down power lines and poles. And in the Deep South, residents in Louisiana and Mississippi were cleaning up from apparent tornadoes that struck overnight. Officials in Mississippi say eight to 10 houses were damaged in Star, a fringe suburb southeast of Jackson. Damage was also reported from a separate storm near Baskin, a rural town southeast of Monroe in Louisiana.The timing for the storms couldn't be much worse. AAA estimates that more than 55 million travelers planned to kick off the holiday season with a trip of 50 miles or more away from home this Thanksgiving. That would be the second-highest Thanksgiving travel volume since AAA began tracking in 2000. About 50 million of them planned to drive, and Wednesday was predicted as the heaviest driving day. Even the East was not secure, with snow in northern New England and high winds forecasted that could knock down trees and power lines."In the wake of this storm moving off the New England coast on Thursday," the National Weather Service said," "the very windy conditions that are currently affecting the Mid West will be pushing eastward, with very windy conditions likely on Thanksgiving across much of the Northeast along with much cooler temperatures compared to the previous days."The rare West Coast “bomb cyclone” swept into southern Oregon and northern California, bringing 100-mph wind gusts to the coast.A bomb cyclone, or bombogenesis, occurs when a storm's central barometric pressure drops at least 24 millibars in 24 hours. (A millibar is a way of measuring air pressure.) The lower the pressure, the more powerful the storm.Thanksgiving travel: 14 winter travel tips for flights and road tripsThe Weather Prediction Center, in a weather summary, called it "a tale of two storms for Thanksgiving week. The first crosses the Central Plains into the Upper Midwest into Wednesday, bringing heavy snow and strong winds. The second (spreads) heavy snow, heavy rain and strong winds across the West."
WASHINGTON – In a stinging rebuke to Turkey, the Senate on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide – marking a shift in U.S. policy despite repeated objections from the Trump administration. The Senate's action is historic, and it will almost certainly exacerbate U.S.-Turkey tensions. The genocide measure officially recognizes the systematic killing of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923.President Donald Trump has cultivated a close relationship with Turkey's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan – hosting Erdogan at the White House in November despite Turkey's recent invasion of Syria. Until Thursday, Trump's GOP allies in the Senate had repeatedly blocked the genocide measure. "I have no doubt that Ergodan has expressed his deep ... opposition to the genocide resolution" in his conversations with Trump, Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., told USA TODAY just before the Senate action.   For years, Turkey had successfully deployed an army of high-priced lobbyists to stop the measure. Ankara spent more than $6 million to press its agenda in Washington in 2018, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog group. But that effort collapsed on Thursday when Menendez pressed for its adoption and no senator objected. The New Jersey Democrat broke down in tears after the measure sailed through, after he began recounting the horrors of the genocide."The killing was done with axes, cleavers, shovels and pitchforks. It was like a slaughterhouse," Menendez said, quoting a priest who documented the atrocities at the time. "Infants were dashed on rocks before the eyes of their mothers." It was clear that Turkey's "ultimate goal was to eliminate the Armenian people," Menendez added."The Senate finally took a stand and spoke the truth – spoke the truth to darkness, spoke truth to evil, spoke truth to murder, spoke truth to genocide – and finally honored the 1.5 million innocent lives lost," said Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican who sponsored the resolution with Menendez.A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. Turkey's ministry of foreign affairs slammed the Senate's unanimous action. "This resolution of the Senate is one of the disgraceful examples of politicization of history," the ministry said in a statement. "Those who exploit history by disregarding reality for their political interests will never achieve their aims."The House overwhelmingly passed the genocide measure in October, amid a wave of anger at Turkey over its decision to attack America's Kurdish allies in Syria, who helped U.S. forces defeat the Islamic State terrorist group. Some critics of Turkey said its attack on the Kurds carried echoes of the Armenian genocide."Members of my own family were among those murdered, and my parents fled with my grandparents to America," Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., a first-generation Armenian-American, said during the House floor debate. "What all of the persecuted had in common was that they were Christians." In an interview this week, Eshoo told USA TODAY that while some may view the resolution as symbolic, it is deeply personal and meaningful to Armenian-Americans like her. As a young girl, Eshoo said she vividly remembers a story her aunt told her. "Her mother had sewn coins into the hem of her skirt" and told her and her sisters to flee as their village came under attack, Eshoo recounted. "When they were running, they looked behind them. The whole village was on fire. They lost their parents."America's refusal to label the murders a "genocide," she said, represented a grievous denial of history and a message to Armenians that "all the lives that were lost" went unrecognized. "The recognition of what actually took place has a sense of cleansing to it," she said.Menendez had previously tried three times to bring it up in the Senate. But each time, a Republican senator objected, reportedly acting at the behest of the White House. On Nov. 13, for example, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a fierce critic of Turkey's invasion of Syria, blocked the genocide measure after the White House expressed concerns about it. Graham told Axios that a White House legislative affairs official had asked him if he would "please object" when Menendez called it up that day. Graham had been at the White House to confront Erdogan over Syria."I said sure," Graham told Axios. "The only reason I did it is because he [Erdogan] was still in town. ... That would've been poor timing. I'm trying to salvage the relationship if possible."The Armenian genocide began in 1915 during World War I, as Turkish leaders began to murder and deport hundreds of thousands of Armenians from the Ottoman Empire. While the modern-day Turkish government has taken steps to address the atrocities, it has refused to recognize the scope of the killings and disputes it was a genocide.For years, Turkish officials have argued that Congress would severely damage U.S.-Turkey relations by passing such a resolution. In an Oct. 25 missive, Turkey's ambassador to the U.S. warned lawmakers that passing the genocide measure could jeopardize future economic cooperation and create a lasting hostility between the two NATO allies."I call upon you not to play a part in creating a permanent negative resentment in our historically close and friendly relations," the diplomat, Serdar Kilic, wrote in the letter. Turkey had also deployed "a phalanx of their lobbyists" to pressure lawmakers to oppose the genocide bill, Menendez told USA TODAY. He said lobbyists on Turkey's payroll were devoting more energy to blocking the genocide resolution than to opposing punitive sanctions legislation that is also gaining steam in the Senate.Menendez said he was thankful the resolution passed "at a time in which there are still survivors of the genocide (and they) will be able to see that the Senate acknowledges what they've been through."Thursday's vote is a blow to Turkey as well as to Trump, said Bulent Aliriza, director of the Turkey Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington foreign policy institute. He said in previous years, Turkey has recalled its ambassador and threatened other counter measures when the genocide bill gained momentum."This shows the weakening ... position of Turkey on Capitol Hill and the inability of Trump to prevent" anti-Turkey bills from advancing in Congress, he said.Like Trump, previous American presidents have intervened to stop Congress from passing the Armenian genocide resolution. "We have significant interests in this troubled region of the world," then-President Bill Clinton wrote in an October 2000 letter to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert. "Consideration of the resolution at this sensitive time will negatively affect those interests and could undermine efforts to encourage improved relations between Armenia and Turkey."That argument seems to have lost its luster now. The U.S.-Turkey alliance has deeply frayed in recent months, not only because of Turkey's invasion of Syria but also because Erdogan pressed ahead with Turkey's decision to purchase a Russian missile system. He took those steps in the face of fierce objections from Washington.Menendez said Trump's embrace of Erdogan was perplexing given those developments. Turkey's opposition to the genocide measure was equally confounding, he said."This was the Ottoman Empire. It wasn't modern-day Turkey," he said. "They should be able to recognize that historical fact and move on. But they're unwilling to do so."  
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan could ease some of the current coronavirus-related curbs on economic activity by allowing places such as parks and museums to reopen, provided proper preventive measures were in place, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Sunday.The remarks come a day before the government is set to announce the extension of its state of emergency after struggling to suppress the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected 15,589 people and killed 530 in the country.“As long as the proper preventive measures are in place, it could be possible to ease some of the current restrictions on economic activities,” Nishimura said at a news conference held on Sunday morning.Places like parks, museums, art galleries, and libraries could reopen even in the 13 prefectures where the coronavirus has spread rapidly, if they take steps to disinfect their premises and ensure visitors maintain their distance, he added.Further details on how restrictions might be eased would be discussed at an expert’s meeting on Monday, Nishimura said.The government-issued state of emergency in Japan is set to expire on Wednesday, the last day of a week-long national holiday. The government is preparing to extend the state of emergency for another month.Under the state of emergency, the government has asked people to stay at home, avoid unnecessary outings, and refrain from going to crowded areas. 
A key model of the coronavirus pandemic favored by the White House nearly doubled its prediction Monday for how many people will die from the virus in the U.S. by August – primarily because states are reopening too soon.The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine is now projecting 134,000 coronavirus-related fatalities, up from a previous prediction of 72,000. Factoring in the scientists’ margin of error, the new prediction ranges from 95,000 to 243,000.Dr. Christopher Murray, the director of IHME, told reporters on a call Monday the primary reason for the increase is many states’ “premature relaxation of social distancing.”For the first time, Murray explained, the model is factoring in data from four different cell phone providers showing a major uptick in Americans’ going out in public.This rise of mobility in the last week or 10 days is likely leading to an increase in transmission, he said.Monday’s update is the fourth since the model debuted in late March. It’s been relied on by the White House in recent months because it presents a more optimistic forecast on health system capacity, cases and deaths than other experts have predicted.Even with its latest forecast, the University of Washington model is still far more optimistic than a model developed by Johns Hopkins for CDC predicting as many as 3,000 deaths per day by June. Murray said that model, which the New York Times published Monday, is likely inaccurate.“Our numbers are nowhere near that level,” he said, noting that IHME is forecasting 890 deaths per day by June 1. “This relates very much to whether the models think there is going to be a large, New York-style epidemic in some states. We don’t see that because we’re building into the modeling the rising temperatures and rising testing and contact tracing. That will put the brakes on transmission enough that we won’t see 3,000 deaths a day by June 1.”In a statement on Monday evening, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health called the leaked models “preliminary analyses,“ saying that they had been provided to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help in scenario planning, were not a final version and were not meant to be used or presented as forecasts.Still, the statement added, “the information illustrates that there are some scenarios, including the premature relaxation of social distancing, that are likely to cause significant increases in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States.“The White House on Monday acknowledged the existence of the internal administration document but asserted that the grim modeling had not gone through interagency vetting and “is not reflective” of any projections from or analyzed by the White House coronavirus task force.In a statement to reporters, White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere said that the internal report obtained by The New York Times was “not a White House document” and hadn’t been presented to the coronavirus task force.The CDC document projects north of 175,000 new cases of Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, each day. That’s up from about 25,000 new cases per day last week and more than four times the peak of about 37,000 new cases per day.The alarming modeling comes as some states are already beginning to put parts of the White House’s phased reopening plan into motion despite concerns that the administration’s guidelines for doing so have not yet been met. It also underscores fears that moving too fast to relax strict social-distancing restrictions could fuel a dangerous second wave of infections.The CDC document found some reason for optimism, noting that nationwide, the trajectory of new illnesses in "multiple counties, including hard hit areas in Louisiana and in the New York City region" has continued to decrease, and that incidence rates have recently plateaued around Chicago.Still, it found that there "remains a large number of counties whose burden [of illness] continues to grow or are in an elevated incidence plateau, including in the Great Lakes region, parts of the Southeast, Northeast, and around southern California." The document includes a color-coded map of the country with darker spots peppered throughout, and it states that the goal "is to have all communities be represented in the lighter colors, demonstrating little to no disease burden and no increase in trajectory."Deere on Monday defended the White House plan, which President Donald Trump released last month with the goal of returning to some semblance of normalcy and reviving an economy that has been shuttered over the past two months due to the virus.The guidelines “are a scientific driven approach that the top health and infectious disease experts in the federal government agreed with,” Deere said. “The health of the American people remains President Trump's top priority and that will continue as we monitor the efforts by states to ease restrictions.”Murray also noted that the updated University of Washington model also now takes into account the ramping up of testing in most states, as well as warming temperatures heading into late spring and early summer. But he cautioned that the impact of temperature on coronavirus transmission is not yet fully understood, and likely will not be for several more months.For now, IHME is assuming that every degree Celsius the temperature goes up will lead to a 2 percent decline in transmission.“Are we sure about that? No,” he said.

THE Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove says he hopes around 80,000 people on the Isle of Wight will download a trial app, designed to trace and track symptoms of coronavirus via our smartphones.The Isle of Wight’s MP Bob Seely is hoping that half of the Isle of Wight’s residents will download and use the app during its trial on the Island this week.Michael Gove told the daily press briefing yesterday (Sunday): “It is one arrow in the quiver. The more people who download the app the better”, saying it would be one of a series of measures designed to help the country move forward. Transport secretary Grant Shapps had earlier revealed the plans for the Isle of Wight trial, on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.This morning, it is reported that the app is anonymous and will not store personal data.Using bluetooth, it will detect if the user has been in contact with someone else who has the app and has used it to report having coronavirus symptoms.The app has not yet been made available to download.Isle of Wight MP Bob Seely told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that he welcomed the trial: “If we can get up to near 50 percent of Islanders using this app, we could be the first place to get rid of this wretched virus in the UK, because we will be hunting it down.”On the Isle of Wight, 127 people have tested positive for Covid-19.In all, 28 peope have died.Council Leader Dave Stewart said: "I am very pleased we can be the first place to use this new digital technology in the country. "People who have been in contact with symptomatic individuals will be identified much earlier than is currently the case, and they will be provided with advice so they can act appropriately to protect themselves and our community.“I really do think this is an amazing opportunity for the Isle of Wight and one I know residents will join with me in embracing.”Concerns have been raised about the security and privacy of people using the app.Isle of Wight Councillor Andrew Garratt warned it should be ‘ethical’ and called for more information about what is being tested, collected and stored. He asked on Twitter what security measures were in place and what will happen if someone wants to stop using it.Dominic Minghella, who has survived coronavirus and written about his experience, said he has concerns about security. Meanwhile, Islanders responded yesterday to claims by The Spectator magazine, over the weekend, that the Isle of Wight was not technologically geared up for the app.Chair of the Isle of Wight Conservative Association, David Pugh called the claim 'absolute nonsense' and Labour’s Richard Quigley called it ‘irksome’. 
WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of perpetrating an "assault" on the nation's democracy after he told ABC News that he'd welcome foreign information on his 2020 opponent."It’s a very sad thing," Pelosi, D-Calif., said. "That's an assault on our democracy. "What the president said last night shows clearly once again … that he does not know the difference between right and wrong," Pelosi said. "And that’s probably the nicest thing I can say about him."The president told ABC's George Stephanopoulos he'd accept dirt on his 2020 opponent from a foreign government and might or might not turn it over to the FBI. Trump argued that such information amounts to "opposition research" widely used by campaigns.Trump's ABC comments: If foreign governments have dirt on 2020 rivals, 'I think I'd take it,' Trump says'Achomlishments': Here are all the times Trump's notes and letters have been photographedThe House speaker said the law prohibits a campaign from accepting an in-kind contribution from a foreign government, which she said includes information.Pelosi said she would pursue a "methodical" approach on deciding whether to launch an impeachment inquiry. "Everybody in the county should be totally appalled by what the president said last night," Pelosi said. "But he has a habit of making appalling statements." Earlier, Pelosi said Trump gave Russians a "green light" to meddle in the 2020 election. "The Russians attacked our elections, and @realDonaldTrump is giving them the green light to do it again," Pelosi said in a tweet."They have information. I think I'd take it," Trump told ABC. "If I thought there was something wrong, I'd go maybe to the FBI – if I thought there was something wrong."Trump said such political help would not be considered interference.Norma Torres: Democratic representative goes after 'sex-starved males' during heated abortion debateArmy: Army reprimands retired four-star general in alleged groping incident from 25 years agoRep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump’s comments are a “dereliction of his duty,” but the California Democrat was not surprised by the admission."The Trump campaign sought such help in 2016, and their candidate just put out word they want more in 2020. It’s up to Congress to put a stop to it,” he said.It wasn't only Democrats who raised concerns about Trump's position. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close White House ally, said, "I think it’s a mistake of law.” 
Dark matter has so far defied every type of detector designed to find it. Because of its huge gravitational footprint in space, we know dark matter must make up about 85 percent of the total mass of the universe, but we don't yet know what it's made of.Several large experiments that hunt for dark matter have searched for signs of dark matter particles knocking into atomic nuclei via a process known as scattering, which can produce tiny flashes of light and other signals in these interactions.Now a new study, led by researchers at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) and UC Berkeley, suggests new paths for catching the signals of dark matter particles that have their energy absorbed by these nuclei.The absorption process could give an affected atom a kick that causes it to eject a lighter, energized particle such as an electron, and it might produce other types of signals, too, depending on the nature of the dark matter particle.The study focuses mostly on those cases where an electron or neutrino is ejected as the dark matter particle strikes an atom's nucleus.Published May 4 in Physical Review Letters, the study proposes that some existing experiments, including ones that search for dark matter particles and processes related to neutrinos—ghostly, detectable particles that can pass through most matter and have the ability to change into different forms—can easily be broadened to also look for these absorption-related types of telltale dark matter signals.Also, the researchers propose that new searches in previously collected particle detector data could possibly turn up these overlooked dark matter signals."In this field, we've had a certain idea in mind about well-motivated candidates for dark matter, such as the WIMP," or weakly interacting massive particle, said Jeff Dror, the lead author of the study who is a postdoctoral researcher in Berkeley Lab's Theory Group and UC Berkeley's Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics.Dark matter pushes at the boundaries of the known fundamental laws of physics, encapsulated in the Standard Model of particle physics, and "The WIMP paradigm is very easy to build into the Standard Model, but we haven't found it for a long time," Dror noted.So, physicists are now considering other places that dark matter particles may be hiding, and other particle possibilities such as theorized "sterile neutrinos" that could also be brought into the family of particles known as fermions—which includes electrons, protons, and neutrinos."It's easy, with small modifications to the WIMP paradigm, to accommodate a whole different type of signal," Dror said. "You can make a huge amount of progress with very little cost if you step back a little bit in the way we've been thinking about dark matter."Robert McGehee, a UC Berkeley graduate student, and Gilly Elor of the University of Washington were study co-authors. The researchers note that the range of new signals they are focusing on opens up an "ocean" of dark matter particle possibilities: namely as-yet-undiscovered fermions with masses lighter than the typical range considered for WIMPs. They could be close cousins of sterile neutrinos, for example.The study team considered absorption processes known as "neutral current," in which nuclei in the detector material recoil, or get jolted by their collision with dark matter particles, producing distinct energy signatures that can be picked up by the detector; and also those known as "charged current," which can produce multiple signals as a dark matter particle strikes a nucleus, causing a recoil and the ejection of an electron.The charge current process can also involve nuclear decay, in which other particles are ejected from a nucleus as a sort of domino effect triggered by the dark matter absorption.Looking for the study's suggested signatures of both the neutral current and charge current processes could open up "orders of magnitude of unexplored parameter space," the researchers note. They focus on energy signals in the MeV, which means millions of electron volts. An electron volt is a measure of energy that physicists use to describe the masses of particles. Meanwhile, typical WIMP searches are now sensitive to particle interactions with energies in the keV range, or thousands of electron volts.For the various particle interactions the researchers explored in the study, "You can predict what is the energy spectrum of the particle coming out or the nucleon that's getting the 'kick,'" Dror said. Nucleon refers to the positively charged proton or uncharged neutron that resides in an atom's nucleus and that could absorb energy when struck by a dark matter particle. These absorption signals could possibly be more common than the other types of signals that dark matter detectors are typically designed to find, he added—we just don't know yet.Experiments that have large volumes of detector material, with high sensitivity and very low background "noise," or unwanted interference from other types of particle signals, are particularly suited for this expanded search for different types of dark matter signals, Dror said.LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), for example, an ultrasensitive Berkeley Lab-led dark matter search project under construction in a former South Dakota mine, is a possible candidate as it will use about 10 metric tons of liquid xenon as its detector medium and is designed to be heavily shielded from other types of particle noise.Already, the team of researchers participating in the study has worked with the team operating the Enriched Xenon Observatory (EXO), an underground experiment searching for a theorized process known as neutrino-less double beta decay using liquid xenon, to open up its search to these other types of dark matter signals.And for similar types of experiments that are up and running, "The data is already basically sitting there. It's just a matter of looking at it," Dror said.The researchers name a laundry list of candidate experiments around the world that could have relevant data and search capabilities that could be used to find their target signals, including: CUORE, LZ predecessor LUX, PandaX-II, XENON1T, KamLAND-Zen, SuperKamiokande, CDMS-II, DarkSide-50, and Borexino among them.As a next step, the research team is hoping to work with experiment collaborations to analyze existing data, and to find out whether search parameters of active experiments can be adjusted to search for other signals."I think the community is starting to become fairly aware of this," Dror said, adding, "One of the biggest questions in the field is the nature of dark matter. We don't know what it is made out of, but answering these questions could be within our reach in the near future. For me, that's a huge motivation to keep pushing—there is new physics out there." 
Southwest Airlines said Thursday it has reached agreement with Boeing to compensate the airline for some of the financial damages from the grounding of the 737 Max.Southwest didn’t disclose the terms of the agreement, but the Dallas-based airline reiterated that it would share $125 million with its employees.“This profitsharing award is based on the projected financial damages for annual 2019 due to the MAX groundings, just as if you had earned profitsharing on those projected profits this year,” Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told employees, who called their performance “nothing short of heroic.”ADVERTISINGAds by TeadsThe low-cost airline said talks with the manufacturer are ongoing and that it expects Boeing to cut prices on Southwest’s current and future aircraft orders because of the grounding. Southwest shares were up 1.6% in early afternoon trading.Boeing declined to comment on the discussions with Southwest or other customers and said in a statement that “we are working closely with all of them to support them through this difficult time.”The Boeing 737 Max has been grounded since mid-March after the the second of two fatal crashes in the span of five months. Southwest is the largest U.S. operator of 737 Max planes and had 34 in its fleet at the time of the grounding.Boeing took a nearly $5 billion after-tax charge in the second quarter to compensate carriers for the flight ban, but the total cost isn’t yet clear because the grounding is ongoing. The Federal Aviation Administration’s top administrator told CNBC on Wednesday that recertification of the plane would stretch into 2020, dashing Boeing’s forecast that regulators would sign off on the jetliners by the end of the year.Under new administrator Steve Dickson, who was sworn in in August, the agency has projected a hard line against Boeing after criticism the agency handed off too much of the 737 Max certification work to the manufacturer. Dickson met with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in Washington, D.C. Thursday, striking a hard stance on the process in message about it to lawmakers.Dickson “is concerned that Boeing continues to pursue a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic due to delays that have for a variety of reasons,” said the email, which was seen by CNBC. “More concerning, the Administrator wants to directly address the perception that some of Boeing’s public statements have been designed to force FAA into taking quicker action.”The FAA following the meeting told lawmakers that Dickson “reminded Mr. Muilenburg that FAA controls the review process and that he has told FAA’s aviation safety experts working on continued review of the 737 MAX to take the time they need to get this right and they have his full support.”He also encouraged Boeing to use a safety-improvement and monitoring system used by airlines.The prolonged grounding, now in its 10th month, has cost airlines including Southwest hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. Southwest has cut routes and scaled back its growth plans with the planes grounded.American Airlines on Thursday took the Max out of its schedule until April 7, more than a full year since regulators grounded the plane. United and Southwest currently have the the 737 Max out of their schedules until early March. Southwest said it doesn’t have any immediate plans to change its schedule but the president of the Southwest pilots’ union told its members in a note Thursday that it doesn’t expect the plane back until “at least” April.Southwest’s pilots union sued Boeing in October, saying the grounding cost them more than $100 million in income.United also said it doesn’t have any immediate plans to change its schedule. A spokesman said the carrier is considering simulator training for its 737 Max pilots, regardless of what the FAA mandates, adding that it hasn’t yet made a decision.
(CNN)A woman is dead after a run-in with an alligator on a South Carolina island, the Charleston County Sheriff's Office said.Deputies responded Friday to a report of an "alligator encounter" with a woman. The incident happened around 5 p.m. at a pond near Salt Cedar Lane on Kiawah Island, the sheriffs office tweeted.A deputy shot and killed the alligator before it was retrieved.The woman killed in the incident was identified by the Charleston County Coroner's Office as Cynthia Covert of Johns Island, South Carolina.Kiawah Island Mayor Craig Weaver called Covert's death "a terrible tragedy.""We live closely with nature on this island. An alligator caused death is exceedingly rare and has not happened on our island before to my knowledge," Weaver said in a statement Sunday. "We know that we must act responsibly and with care around these animals. Consequently, it will be important to know and to share with the community the facts and circumstances from this tragedy, so we can avoid experiencing anything like this again," Weaver said.The Charleston County Sheriff's Office, the Charleston County Coroner's Office, and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources are investigating the incident, Weaver said.CNN reached out to the Charleston County Sheriff's Office for additional information.
Adele showed off her incredible seven stone weight loss in a tight black mini as she shared a rare Instagram post on Tuesday.The Hello singer was celebrating her 32nd birthday and stood beaming in her backyard behind a giant floral wreath.'Thank you for the birthday love. I hope you’re all staying safe and sane during this crazy time,' captioned the superstar. 'I’d like to thank all of our first responders and essential workers who are keeping us safe while risking their lives! You are truly our angels ♥️ 2020 okay bye thanks x'.Her birthday picture marked Adele's first Instagram upload since she stunned the world with her new svelte frame in photos from her Christmas party last year.Adele, who has been sticking to a 1000-a-day calorie diet and also doing Pilates, had slipped into a shimmering gown and posed up a storm beside men dressed as the Grinch and Santa Claus. Chrissy Teigen had something to say about her most recent snap and wrote: 'I mean are you kidding me,'  and The Ellen Show's Kalen Allen said: 'THAT WAIST IS SNATCHEDDDDDDD!!!!'Make-up artist James Charles posted: 'YOU LOOK AMAZING' and Burberry's Chief Creative Officer Riccardo Tisci added, 'Happy birthday beautiful.'And Adele's fans also commented on her appearance, with one writing: 'Don't be shy drop the diet/workout routine,' while another said: 'Check how skinny she is wowowow.'Meanwhile, it was recently claimed that Adele is in a 'groove' with her new fitness regime.The singer has become increasingly health-conscious over recent months and a source close to the star praised her disciplined approach to her own wellbeing.An insider told E! News: 'She goes to different gyms. She goes early in the morning and meets with her trainer.'She gets her workout in first thing. She works out for about an hour and leaves drenched in sweat and looking like she worked very hard.'Adele reportedly attends a couple of private fitness classes every week.The source added: 'She's also staying active going on walks and getting in a lot of steps. She is in a groove.'   On Tuesday, Adele's friend Lauren Paul, 33, married to Breaking Bad actor, Aaron, 40, shared a throwback picture of them partying in Vegas with Nicole Richie. She wrote: 'Happy birthday angel babe @adele. You came into my life a few months before I had Story [her daughter], and you quickly became one of the most important figures in my journey as a new mother. 'You have taught me so much. You glow because your heart is full. I'm so proud of the human you are. Wish we were reliving this Vegas sleepover.' She also shared a picture of herself and Adele on a road trip together. Adele's friend, author and editor, Jedidiah Jenkins, shared another picture of them in a car, with Adele wearing a headscarf and chic sunglasses. In October, Adele had already visibly lost a great deal of weight as seen in pictures of her attending her friend Drake's birthday party.She posted an Instagram snap of herself at the fete and quipped in the caption: 'I used to cry but now I sweat'.In January she went on holiday to Anguilla with Harry Styles and James Corden, and met a 19-year-old fan called Lexi Larson who dished to People about their weight loss conversation. 'She said she lost something like 100 pounds, and that it’s such a crazy positive experience. She seemed so happy, and she looked amazing. She seemed really confident,' Lexi shared with the magazine.The pop superstar's big reveal came after she split from her husband Simon Konecki last April and filed for divorce in September.Adele and Simon share a seven-year-old son called Angelo and a People insider revealed her weight loss came partly from a desire to be healthier for her child.'She got to the point where she didn’t feel great. She knew she had to change something, because she wants to be the healthiest mom possible,' said the source.Pals: Adele's friend Lauren is married to Breaking Bad actor Aaron Paul - they have a daughter called Story together and Lauren credits Adele with helping her as a new mother (pictured in March)The insider added: 'Her whole focus during the weight loss journey has really been all about how she can be healthier and how can she treat her body better. It was never about losing weight.' A friend previously said the split had given her a new lease of life. They told The Sun: 'Adele has been out enjoying herself and she sees that as her priority at the moment, along with being a mum to Angelo.'She has been loving her new workout regime and it really works for her. It’s a bonus that she has shifted some weight.'Her mates are glad she’s letting loose and there’s nothing but good feelings towards her. She’s got a new lease of life.'Adele and Simon first began dating in 2011 and welcomed their son the following year in 2012.The pair then married four years later, wedding in secret, with Adele choosing to address their wedding for the first time during an acceptance speech at the Grammys in 2017.Adele first confirmed her split from Simon in April, earlier this year, and filed for divorce in September, with her ex reportedly agreeing to joint custody of their son Angelo just days later. At the time, a source told People that the former couple are 'staying friendly' for the sake of their son.'They’re raising Angelo with love, warmth and real respect for each other,' the insider claimed. 'Adele and Simon are eager to stay friendly because of their child.'A month after filing for divorce, Adele was romantically linked to British rapper and Grime artist Skepta, but it was claimed their relationship was never 'serious'.In December, reports surfaced suggesting Adele has since 'grown closer' to US record producer Jonathan Hay, who she is thought to have met earlier this year in New York at Quad Recording Studios.Adele became a body positivity icon for her larger figure when she first rose to global stardom, proudly declaring on 60 Minutes in 2012: 'I don't wanna be some skinny mini with my t**s out. I really don't wanna do it.'However she became noticeably slimmer in 2016 and that year a source told the Daily Mail she was relying on the 'Sirtfood Diet.'Last year she embarked on another astonishing transformation with The Sun reporting in June that she was doing reformer Pilates with Robbie Williams's wife Ayda Field.Her new figure is also reportedly partly due to the Sirtfood Diet, which Glen Matten and Aidan Goggins debuted in a book in 2016.The diet reportedly allows Adele to indulge in red wine and coffee while stressing a regime of plant products like turmeric, kale, buckwheat and green tea.These items are said to activate a person's sirtuins, also known as 'housekeeping genes,' which suppress appetite by controlling bodily response to sugar and fat.This January Adele's former personal trainer 'Brazilian body wizard' Camila Goodis appeared on Lorraine and shed light on how the singing star took the pounds off.'She's working out but I think 90% of it is diet,' said Camila, a 31-year-old who is based out of Los Angeles.'It's a good diet to shed the weight. The first week is intense, green juices and only 1,000 calories. She doesn't look too thin - she looks amazing.'Camila told The Sun she met Adele through Ayda, who has been married since 2010 to English musician Robbie Williams of Take That fame.She theorized Adele 'has probably cut out processed foods and is eating soy and other plant-based foods.'The fitness trainer added: 'She’s found a diet that works for her. She looks younger and, more importantly, she looks happy.'Back in Februrary, a health expert on British daytime TV show, This Morning, suggested Adele's alleged '1000-calorie-a-day' diet isn't sustainable in the long term. Food writer, Dale Pinnock - aka the Medicinal Chef - warned the diet could have adverse side effects such as brain fog and irritability.  Dale explained: 'If you've got a short-term goal that kind of approach could be very, very suitable - if you want to lose weight for a wedding or holiday.'But it isn't sustainable. There will be a cut off because after a while your body will start to down regulate the things it will do.'He reminded people at home that the recommended daily intake for a woman is between 1,800 and 2,000 calories.'[The body's] top priority is survival, after a couple of weeks you won't be as active, you'll find that you get brain fog and become irritable, it kicks in quite quickly.'Slow and steady wins the race, definitely - find something that you can stick to.'This Morning's resident doctor Zoe Williams was in agreement, advising viewers to make small changes they will be able to stick to.Wellbeing & Lifestyle Consultant Yvonne Wake at Karidis Clinic recently said: 'Adele looks completely different because she has lost a lot of adipose tissue from her entire body.'We hold on to water and our bodies are highly inflamed when we are overweight.'This transformation will always show in our faces fairly quickly when we lose weight.'Her rapid weight loss will also show out as her looking so very different, but that’s just what happens when the body starts to look after itself better.'I think it suits Adele to have lost this weight, and it's healthy for her heart if done in the right way'.Last Thursday Adele's makeup artist of 12 years Michael Ashton posted an Instagram snap of her and wrote: ''BTW.... EXCITING NEWS COMING SOON!!'His cryptic caption sent fans into a tizz as they theorized that he was hinting at new music from Adele, whose most recent album 25 was released in 2015.Earlier last month Adele was Live on Instagram with producers Babyface and Teddy Riley, and as their stream got repeatedly interrupted by glitches she cracked: Come on, it's 2020 - we ain't meant to get what we want!'Although Adele's next album is slated to drop this September her quip led some fans to worry that the release may be pushed until 2021. 
Amazon is already delivering about half of its own packages in the U.S., according to a Morgan Stanley estimate on Thursday, and will soon pass both United Parcel Service and FedEx in total volume.“Our AlphaWise analysis shows that Amazon Logistics already delivers ~50% of Amazon US volumes, focused on urban areas,” Morgan Stanley said.Amazon Logistics is the e-commerce giant’s in-house logistics operation. Morgan Stanley said Amazon Logistics “more than doubled its share” of U.S. package volumes from about 20% a year ago and is now shipping at a rate of 2.5 billion per year. For comparison, Morgan Stanley estimates UPS and FedEx have U.S. shipping volumes of 4.7 billion and 3 billion packages per year, respectively.”“We see more of this going forward as our new bottom-up US package model assumes Amazon Logistics US packages grow at a 68% [compound annual growth rate from 2018 to 2022],” Morgan Stanley said.That would put Amazon Logistics at 6.5 billion packages per year by 2022, according to the firm, far exceeding its estimate for UPS at 5 billion packages per year and FedEx at 3.4 billion packages per year.“To us, Amazon Logistics is already-large scale and with a fleet ~1/5 the size of competitors, it speaks to its ability to use density and technology to drive efficiency,” Morgan Stanley said.20% upside?The firm says Amazon Logistics is more focused than its competitors on densely populated areas. According to Morgan Stanley’s estimate, about 61% of Amazon Logistics’ package volumes are from suburban areas, 28% are from urban areas, and just 11% are from rural areas. That makes Amazon Logistics’ rural focus about half of its competitors, as the rest of the industry typically derives 20% of package volume from rural areas, the firm said.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Amazon shares, with a $2,100 price target that is nearly 20% above the stock’s current level.The firm also lowered its price target on both UPS shares to $78 from $85 — about 33% below its current price — and FedEx shares to $111 from $120 — which would be a drop of about 32% from current levels. Morgan Stanley has an underweight rating on UPS and an equal-weight rating on FedEx.
For weeks the Trump reelection effort has diligently cut, catalogued and pushed out viral videos of every verbal stumble Joe Biden makes in interviews, relentlessly pushing the idea that the presumptive Democratic nominee is mentally unfit for the presidency.“There is something missing,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said last week in a campaign broadcast. “I feel bad for him. I wish his wife would pull him out of this.”But behind the scenes, the offensive has become a point of contention among some of President Trump’s closest advisers, who have spent weeks debating without resolution the best message and strategy to accomplish the Trump campaign’s central goal of tarnishing the Biden brand as poll numbers continue to show a rocky road to reelection for the president.Several political advisers, including White House senior aide Kellyanne Conway, have warned his allies against relentlessly mocking the 77-year-old Biden’s mental acuity because the president has already lost ground with senior citizens, people familiar with the matter said.Senior Democratic and Republican strategists, in private conversations, are in full agreement about the stakes of the discussions now taking place at the White House and in campaign conference calls. If President Trump and his political machine don’t find a way to drive up Biden’s unpopularity with voters, they argue, the president will have little shot at winning a second term.“We have to introduce people to a different Joe Biden,” a Trump campaign adviser said. “One of the reasons we won in 2016 is because so many people hated Hillary Clinton. I’m not sure people hate Biden that much.”Republicans need the election to be a choice between Biden and Trump and not a referendum on the president’s performance and rhetoric in office, according to Republican and Democratic strategists. On this score, Democrats said they are — for the moment — more bullish on Biden’s prospects than they expected to be just a few months ago.ADThe debate over when and how to launch a focused and sustained attack on Biden with paid advertising has yet to be resolved inside the president’s campaign, according to multiple sources.“There are advisers telling him to wait until the convention. Other people saying go at it now,” said one Trump campaign adviser, who like others requested anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. “It is not decided.”Adding to the dilemma for the president’s campaign is that the coronavirus pandemic has focused the spotlight brightly on the president and his controversial handling of the outbreak while Biden maintains a relatively low profile, doing interviews and virtual campaign events from a basement office at his home in Delaware.The latest on the pandemic and the Trump administration’s responseThe pandemic has delayed a widely expected anti-Biden advertising offensive by the vastly wealthier Trump campaign, allowing Democratic super PACs to outspend Republicans in key swing states over the last month. Biden’s approval ratings are also far stronger than those of the last Democratic nominee, Clinton, at this point in 2016.“Our expectation was always that Trump would go on offense early and we’d have to scramble to defend against his attacks,” said Josh Schwerin, an adviser to Priorities USA, a super PAC supporting Biden. “The reality has been we’ve been able to run millions of dollars of thoroughly researched and tested ads, largely unanswered, and Trump’s numbers in these states have been eroding badly.”Trump decided last month to delay a decision by his campaign leadership to run ads attacking Biden’s policy toward China, after multiple advisers urged him to focus on selling his leadership as president during the pandemic first. As a result, the campaign has said it will spend more than $1 million over the next week on advertising across the country promoting Trump’s pandemic response, a move that Democrats have dismissed as a cosmetic move to please the president, who is consumed by what he watches on cable television.Parscale has repeatedly argued that getting Biden’s unfavorable numbers up is key to winning the election in November, according to people who have heard his comments.He has told other campaign advisers that positive ads do not do as much for the president's political fortunes as negative ads against Biden, and that is why he wants to focus on campaign ads that are anti-Biden, even as some advisers would prefer a different approach.“You can’t let Biden hide in the shadows,” Parscale has told surrogates, according to a person with direct knowledge of his comments.Parscale has been among the most aggressive advocates in going after Biden, but his standing has become shaky at times with the president, four Trump advisers said.Trump’s team hopes to target Biden particularly over China once the pandemic wanes along with trade deals and some of the more liberal policy positions he committed to during the Democratic debates, such as health care for undocumented immigrants. The Trump campaign has several ads about China ready to go.A recent Republican National Committee poll showed 51 percent of voters in 17 swing states — such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — blame China the most for the coronavirus, according to a person briefed on the results. Some 24 percent blame Trump the most.The polling on China is so strong that the major Trump super PAC, America First Action, has launched a $10 million campaign casting Biden as “weak” on handling the U.S. rival. The group purchased the Web address BeijingBiden.com in 2019, long before the pandemic.“It is not that there is one line of attack against Joe Biden. The most damaging thing against Joe Biden is that while he has high name ID, the depth of impression of him is weak,” America First Action president Brian O. Walsh said. “He is relatively a blank slate.”The America First spots have been matched by a similar investment in the same states from the pro-Biden super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, which has been running ads that cast Trump as caving to pressure from China.“Since November, we’ve defined Trump in key battlegrounds — outspending him on TV and radio in our target states,” said Bradley Beychok, the group’s president.Some Trump allies and campaign surrogates are also focusing on the allegation from Tara Reade that Biden sexually assaulted her in the early 1990s — an accusation Biden denies — as well as the former vice president’s tendency to make verbal gaffes. But the latter two arguments are challenging given the president’s history of women accusing him of sexual assault, which includes Trump caught on tape bragging about grabbing women’s genitals, and his tendency to also veer off script into meandering, untruthful comments.Trump has complicated the matter further this week by repeatedly suggesting in public that Reade’s allegation may be false.“I would just say to Joe Biden, ‘Just go out and fight it,’ ” Trump said Friday during an interview with conservative podcast host Dan Bongino.A number of Trump’s top political advisers said they are frustrated that Biden is “hiding out” in his basement, making fewer gaffes and public comments than they hoped, even if they anticipated this before the pandemic.“We always thought he was going to play Biden-seek once he got the nomination, leaving it to his ads and his handlers to shape his image. This has given him an ability to do that,” Ronna McDaniel, chair of the RNC, said in an interview.Trump’s advisers have taken heart in some recent internal polls that show voters seeing the president as more energetic and more of a “not your average politician” than Biden. Some 20 percent see Trump as not an average politician, according to a recent RNC poll reviewed by The Washington Post, while 69 percent see Biden as more of a normal politician.ADSome Trump advisers said they are happy that Biden is basically being a pundit on TV instead of calling troops overseas, working with food banks or doing things that would get him more positive media coverage and draw a contrast with the president during the pandemic.Conway has been one of the adviser’s arguing for a delay in attacking Biden on China and along with others has pushed for going after him as an establishment, insider politician.“To me, it’s just sequence. You have the president, you have the secretary of state, you have many Democrats angry with China about the virus,” she said in an interview. “You set that groundwork now. And then, later, you say Biden has spent four decades being compliant and complacent. It’s about sequencing.”The Biden campaign dismissed the idea that the former vice president is vulnerable on the issue of China.“Kellyanne Conway should read the Trump campaign’s own polling, which shows Joe Biden winning in a landslide after sounding the alarm about coronavirus early, publicly warning Donald Trump not to trust the Chinese government about containment, and calling for testing on the scale we need to overcome this outbreak,” said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign.Working from the White House while many top campaign aides are at home during the pandemic, Conway has been dispatched to help the president improve his numbers among senior citizens, which have dropped in recent public and internal polling. She helped orchestrate an event at the White House on Thursday where Trump spoke with leaders of senior citizens groups.Recent RNC polling showed that voters in the 17 swing states — a list that includes Arizona, Florida and North Carolina — see the two men as essentially equal when it comes to being “weak or confused,” 45 percent saw Biden as more weak and confused, while 44 percent saw Trump that way.Voters view Trump as more of an outsider — 69 percent to 20 percent — and better at getting things done and handling the economy. Some 46 percent say Trump is in better health, while 37 percent say Biden is in better health.But voters say Biden better understands average people and is more honest, compassionate, calm and committed to making health care more affordable by double-digit margins, the poll showed. Voters also see Biden as more intelligent and competent, the poll showed.Trump aides have been discussing attacks that range from going after Biden for not supporting the raid on Osama bin Laden to supporting taxpayer-funded health care for illegal immigrants and supporting the Green New Deal and its champion liberal freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), according to Republican officials. Other attacks would focus on Biden’s support of the Iraq War or backing the NAFTA trade agreement, Trump advisers said.They are also looking to exploit divisions in the Democratic Party — from liberals who are skeptical of Biden’s more centrist positions to moderates and independents who are skeptical of him promising more liberal positions. Trump advisers say they hope to unearth more contentious Senate votes and want to see his papers at the University of Delaware covering his 36 years as a senator.In 2016, Trump and his campaign were successful in making Hillary Clinton unpopular, magnifying concerns that predated the campaign by focusing on her government emails, foreign entanglements, speaking fees and long career as a Washington insider.Like Clinton, Biden has spent decades in Washington as a political insider, but Trump, who withstood a massive negative advertising onslaught in 2016, is now running for reelection as the president, potentially blunting the attack.“It will be interesting to see if it works,” said Amanda Loveday, an adviser to the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country. “Because it didn’t work against Donald Trump. And I would argue it didn’t work against Hillary Clinton because the people who didn’t like her already didn’t like her.”
As the plumes rise from a brazen attack in the Gulf of Oman, oil brokers and diplomats are panicking about another lurch toward confrontation In the Middle East.What happened is fairly clear -- two tankers were struck as they sailed through this busy and strategic shipping lane -- but why it happened and who did it is a lot less easy to explain, not least because it doesn't appear to benefit any of the protagonists in the region.The Japanese-owned Kokuka Corageous tanker briefly caught fire when it was twice attacked with "some kind of shell," its owner said. One of its 21-strong Filipino crew was injured.The crew of the Bermuda-based Front Altair all escaped unharmed when it too was hit by a blast. The US Fifth Fleet's destroyer USS Bainbridge was nearby and responded to a distress call received at 6:12 a.m. local time and then another 48 minutes later. It picked up 21 sailors from the Kokuka and is getting a wider view of the scene from a P-8 Navy surveillance aircraft.With the rescue operation over, questions have turned to why anyone would do this. That's not as not as straightforward to answer as it looks.Inevitably, similarities have been drawn between Thursday's attacks and events a month ago, when four ships were targeted near the Emirati port of Furajah. For that, officials in Washington and beyond pointed the finger at Iran.But Thursday's incident is significantly more blatant. Yet the same officials will doubtless blame Tehran again. If and when that happens, we should remember US national security advisor John Bolton promised to present evidence to the UN Security Council backing up those previous claims, but has yet to do so.Who stands to gain?The Russians like to ask: "Who did it benefit?" when the unexpected strikes, and this question is useful now.Iran doesn't appear to have a lot to gain. Say what you like about Tehran's malicious intent, these incidents heighten the global drumbeat for greater isolation and boosts those who seek to apply military pressure on Iran. Its economy is in a bad condition. Before President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the JCPOA (colloquially known as the Iran nuclear deal), Tehran was at its peak of regional influence. With diminished economic resources, its potency is likely to wane.The incidents also came in the middle of a visit to Tehran by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, apparently trying to mediate over the nuclear deal (although Tokyo says he's not an envoy for Washington). The apparent attacks eclipsed the Abe visit, an unexpected bit of outreach to Iran by someone Trump calls a friend.You could make a case for Iranian hardliners staging such an attack to derail peace efforts. But Iran's hardliners -- particularly the Revolutionary Guard -- are normally a little smarter than to bomb international shipping lanes during a crucial diplomatic meeting. Iran's chief moderate, Foreign Minister Javid Zarif, was right to point out that "suspicious doesn't begin to describe what likely transpired this morning." When one party is so easily blamed, it is likely blameless, or unfathomably stupid.What else? Reuters has reported that Tehran has been scaling up its remaining petrochemical exports ahead of tightening sanctions. Could it be looking to boost the price of oil? Maybe. But at the same time, the shipping of that same oil is going to be disrupted, so they would likely lose out all the same. It is hard to imagine an Iranian hardliner smart enough to pull this sort of apparent attack off, without also realizing they would get immediately collared.So what about the conspiracy theory, that Saudi Arabia also seeks confrontation and higher oil prices, and would therefore permit such an attack to further its own agenda? An equally obvious explanation, it's tough sell, too. And were such a plot uncovered, the damage to Saudi Arabia's already beleaguered reputation in the Beltway could be terminal.Some 20% of the world's oil goes through the Strait of Hormuz, and that includes a lot of Saudi exports. You might argue that at $62 a barrel (the price of Brent crude after Thursday's incidents caused a 3% spike), oil is quite cheap and can take more of a knocking. But in the long term it's unlikely the Saudis would want the Gulf's shipping lanes to be regarded as unsafe.If this gets worse and the US military finds itself dragged into protecting shipping in Hormuz, Riyadh's relationship the Trump administration -- which sought to get out of foreign entanglements rather than get into them -- would be tested.There are few easy facts here, as there are few easy culprits. But the sense of uncertainty stokes rather than dampens the fears of mismanagement and conflict.
Facing a shorter holiday shopping season this year, U.S. retailers started rolling out their Black Friday deals earlier than usual. That move has paid off, according to new e-commerce data shared by Adobe Analytics this morning, which found that U.S. consumers have already spent $50.1 billion online between November 1 and November 26, 2019 — which represents a comparable increase of 15.8 percent year-over-year.This year, Thanksgiving arrived on November 28, a full week later than it did in 2018 when it came on November 22. That left retailers with 6 fewer days to drive post-Thanksgiving Day sales — a situation it hadn’t been in since 2013, when the shorter time frame led to serious delivery struggles. To salvage the lost shopping days (and to not again find themselves in a similar situation as 2013), retailers simply rolled out their deals a week early.For example, Amazon kicked off a Black Friday deals week on November 22. Walmart introduced early savings through “Buy Now” deals on Walmart.com, in addition to a pre-Black Friday event that started on Nov. 22. Target integrated Shipt’s same-day shopping service into its app and ran a preview sale, weekend deals, and today, Nov. 27, an early access sale. Other retailers followed suit, as well.But consumers weren’t even waiting for these Black Friday preview deals to start shopping. According to Adobe Analytics, which tracks online transactions for 80 of the top 100 U.S. retailers, all 26 days in November so far have surpassed $1 billion in online sales. Seven days even passed $2 billion in sales, which made 2019 the first year to see multiple $2 billion days this early in the shopping season.And as of this morning, $240 million has already been spent online, representing 19.3% growth year-over-year, and putting the day on track to hit $2.9 billion.Based on this data, Adobe believes its earlier forecast of $143.7 billion spent during the full holiday shopping season (Nov.-Dec.) remains accurate. That estimate represents a 14.1% rise from a year ago, according to Adobe. In addition, the three biggest shopping days — Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday — will also see increases, it says.Thanksgiving Day sales are forecast to jump 19.7% year-over-year to $4.4 billion; Black Friday is expected to grow by 20.5% to reach $7.5 billion; and Cyber Monday sales are expected to top the charts at $9.4 billion, an increase of 19.1% year-over-year — a new record.The firm also sees a surge in mobile shopping this year, with 34.3% of all e-commerce sales being made via a smartphone, up 24.2% year-over-year. App Annie’s mobile shopping forecast had also predicted a record number of mobile shoppers, with a 25% year-over-year increase in time spent mobile shopping during the weeks of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The firm said shoppers will spend 2.2 billion hours globally (outside China) across shopping apps this holiday season.Other notable trends include a rise in “buy online, pickup in-store” shopping — 61% will take advantage of this, leading to 27% more in sales over last year. Plus email promotions this season have led to 16.5% of all online revenue, up 10% year-over-year. Paid search accounted for 23.7% of sales, while social media led to just 2.8%.In terms of products, shoppers are buying Apple AirPods, Apple Laptops, Samsung and LG TV’s, Frozen 2 toys, L.O.L Surprise Dolls, NERF toys, Pikmi Pops, Fortnite toys, and games like Pokemon Sword/Shield, Jedi Fallen Order, and Madden 20.“With the shorter shopping season and retailers starting their promotions earlier, Adobe is seeing holiday discounts already well underway even before Thanksgiving Day,” said Jason Woosley, Vice President of Commerce Product & Platform at Adobe. “For televisions alone, shoppers are already seeing discounts twice as deep as expected with average savings yesterday of 17.5%. Those consumers who grab their smartphone to do some quick online shopping after dinner are likely to find offers that are even better than this time last year,” he added.
AT&T has cancelled early orders for the Samsung Galaxy Fold.Tom’s Guide first reported the cancellation, noting that AT&T said the Galaxy Fold would be available again to order as soon as Samsung announces a new launch date. AT&T is offering $100 in credit to those whose orders it has cancelled.The Samsung Galaxy Fold was originally scheduled to launch on April 26. However, early reviews indicated there were issues with the phone, which Samsung initially said was the fault of reviewers. The company eventually decided to postpone the launch and get back to the drawing board.Earlier this week, a Samsung rep told Cnet that it would announce timing on the nearly $2,000 phone “in the coming weeks.”However, AT&T’s move here suggests that it may be a while before the Galaxy Fold resurfaces, if at all.Samsung itself asked customers who pre-ordered to confirm that they still want the device following the review period. On May 24, Best Buy cancelled all pre-orders of the phone.
As Disney announced their plans to reopen their Shanghai parks, Disney's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pamela Hymel gave an update on what you can expect once its other parks, resorts and stores reopen.The company is looking into phased reopening at all locations, whether it be a gradual reopening or partial for certain areas.That could include retail and dining opening before the theme parks.Hymel said Disney is working to manage guest density and social distancing with, not just restaurants and hotels, but queues and ride vehicles. The measure will likely include guest capacity that matches state and federal guidelines to keep visitors and employees safe.Disney is also looking into virtual queues for Disney World and Disneyland with the help of their app.Like most businesses, Disney plans to increase their cleaning and figure out where the high-traffic areas in locations are.As for screening and prevention of the spread of coronavirus, Hymel said they will follow the guidance from the government and the medical community when it comes to enhanced screening. That includes measures such as face coverings. Disney has already added extra hand sanitizer and hand washing stations at resorts.Cast members will recieve new training and reinforcement when Disney locations get closer to reopening."Given the constantly changing global health environment, these practices may evolve as we consider the latest guidance, but we will share more information with you as we look towards reopening," Hymel said. "We’re looking forward to welcoming all of you back to our Disney parks, resorts and stores."
Dec 12 (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 hit a record high on Thursday after President Donald Trump said in a tweet that the United States was getting very close to a “big deal” with China.The S&P 500 was up 16.28 points, or 0.52%, at 3,157.91 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 140.75 points, or 0.50%, at 28,052.05.The Nasdaq Composite was up 38.29 points, or 0.44%, at 8,692.34.U.S. stocks opened modestly lower on Thursday, weighed down by losses in Apple after Credit Suisse said iPhone shipments sharply fell in China last month, while a U.S. tariff deadline on Chinese imports loomed.

(Reuters) - A U.S. government watchdog is raising fresh concerns that health insurers are exaggerating how sick Medicare patients are, receiving billions of dollars in improper payments as a result.Health insurers selling Medicare Advantage plans to seniors and the disabled received an estimated $6.7 billion in 2017 after adding diagnoses to patients’ files that were not supported by their medical records, according to a report released on Thursday by the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Inspector General’s Office.Inspectors found that Medicare Advantage insurers had added diagnoses for diabetes, heart disease and other conditions in 99.3% of chart reviews of patient information, even though they did not appear in records from doctors, hospitals or other medical providers. Insurers deleted incorrect diagnoses less than 1% of the time, they found.The additional diagnoses boosted government payments to insurers by an estimated $6.9 billion, while the deleted information trimmed payouts by nearly $200 million, producing a net benefit of $6.7 billion for the companies.“We could not see any services with the diagnosis and that raised a number of concerns,” Linda Ragone, a regional inspector general in Philadelphia and co-author of the report, said in a phone interview. “There is a vulnerability here that needs to be addressed.”The report highlighted a group of 4,616 Medicare Advantage enrollees for whom insurers added a diagnosis that resulted in a higher payment, even though there was no record of the person receiving any medical services during the year under review.Medicare Advantage plans are privately-run alternatives to traditional Medicare. They served 22 million people – or 1 in 3 of those eligible for the government healthcare program – at a cost of $210 billion in 2018.The report did not identify specific insurers. UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), Humana Inc (HUM.N) and CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) through its ownership of Aetna, are among the biggest sellers of Medicare Advantage plans. Together, the three companies have 54% of the market, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), an industry trade group, said the rate of improper payments in the Medicare Advantage program has been decreasing.“Everyone agrees that Medicare Advantage payments must be fair and accurate, and we continue to work with (Medicare) to improve payment accuracy,” said AHIP spokeswoman Kristine Grow.The U.S. government pays Medicare Advantage insurers based on a risk score for each enrollee. The formula pays more for sicker patients, creating a financial incentive for insurers to inflate risk scores.The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should be doing more to prevent insurers from exploiting this vulnerability, the inspector general said.In a Nov. 1 letter to the inspector general’s office cited in the report, CMS challenged the $6.7 billion estimate of payments linked to chart reviews as too high. The agency agreed with the report’s recommendations for increased oversight and audits.CMS in a statement said it is “committed to ensuring that Medicare Advantage plans submit accurate information to CMS so that payments to plans are appropriate.”Prior to these findings, Medicare estimated it had made $40 billion in overpayments to insurers from 2013 to 2016 due to diagnoses submitted by health plans not supported by medical records.
With billions of dollars on the line, Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, and his ex-wife, novelist MacKenzie Bezos, announced on Thursday that they are in the process of finalizing their divorce.After months of speculation surrounding the future of Amazon and the personal valuation of Bezos, the ex-couple revealed on Twitter how their stock is being divided.As it turns out, Jeff Bezos is exiting the marriage (still) richer than everyone else in the world.$110 billion net worthMacKenzie Bezos said in a tweet that the Amazon CEO will retain 75% of the couple’s Amazon stock, along with voting control of his ex-wife’s shares “to support his continued contributions with the teams of these incredible companies,’’ she said.That means that the Amazon CEO still reigns as the richest person on the planet, with a net worth of more than $110 billion, according to Forbes. Bill Gates is the world’s second-wealthiest individual, boasting an estimated $99.5-billion fortune, Forbes reports.“Happy to be giving him all of my interests in the Washington Post and Blue Origin," Mackenzie tweeted. Blue Origin is Jeff's space exploration company, and he bought the Washington Post for $250 million in 2013.Amazon vs. Apple? Amazon may be gearing up to take on Apple's AirPods, report saysAmazon Internet? Filings show company working on high-speed satellite internet service$35.7 billion in sharesThe Amazon tycoon will transfer roughly 4% of Amazon's stock to his ex-wife, according to an SEC filing dated April 4. The transfer, which is likely to happen by early July, equates to roughly 19.7 million shares worth about $35.7 billion, according to Bloomberg. Amazon’s stock was down about 0.4% Thursday afternoon following the news and closed down 0.1%.Mackenzie is leaving the marriage as one of the richest women in the world.With a $35.7-billion fortune, she ranks third behind L’Oréal’s heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who is worth an estimated $52.9 billion, and Walmart’s Alice Walton, who is worth $45 billion, according to Forbes. Overall, Mackenzie would be the 26th-richest person on the planet, Forbes reports. Speaking of his former wife, Jeff Bezos tweeted, "I'm grateful for her support and for her kindness in this process and am very much looking forward to our new relationship as friends and co-parents.''It remains unclear how the couple will split their real-estate holdings. The family owns at least six large properties across the U.S., according to Business Insider. Is it the most expensive divorce in history?Yes.While some of the financial terms of the Bezos split remain up in the air, the stock alone dwarfs each of the world's previous billion-dollar breakups.The second biggest divorce happened 20 years ago between New York socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein, 78, and Alec Wildenstein, a 67-year-old art dealer. Jocelyn was awarded $2.5 billion and an annual $100 million for 13 years, according to Reuters.Rupert and Anna Murdoch's $1.7-billion divorce happened that same year. The media mogul and his former wife split after being married for 32 years.
Flying taxis are undoubtedly an exciting concept — one that Uber has put a lot of work into making a reality. In order for these electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles to become a reality, they need to have proper batteries, approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, buy-in from cities, public acceptance and, of course, vehicle partners.Uber  is aiming to start testing these aircrafts next year, and wants to commercially deploy Uber Air in Los Angeles, Calif., Dallas-Fort Worth/Frisco, Texas and Melbourne, Australia in 2023.Right now, the model of Uber Air we may see in the skies will have a pilot on board. The model Uber unveiled at Elevate seats four people and one pilot.But there are a lot of moving parts, and the more moving parts there are means more room for error.Designing the right batteryLet’s start with the batteries. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi  has repeatedly said that these vehicles need to be all-electric. But the batteries are nowhere close to where they need to be, Uber Director of Engineering for Energy Storage Systems Celina Mikolajczak told TechCrunch at Uber’s third annual Elevate Summit in Washington, D.C. this week.Within the battery department alone, there are a lot of pieces to it, Mikolajczak said.“The first thing you want is you want a cell that is capable of achieving the mission, and we’ve been working to try and identify cells that can do this job,” she said.To be clear, the job is to travel up to at least 60 miles on a single charge, with a cruise speed of 150 mph. Mikolajczak is confident that current battery technology can achieve the mission, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t challenges. There are challenges around weight, thermal management and safety.
The ECG function of the Apple Watch has been credited with uncovering a heart condition in an 80-year-old woman in Germany, one that was seemingly missed by a hospital's own ECG during a diagnosis.The Apple Watch has repeatedly appeared in stories where it warned wearers of possible heart problems, and has been praised for being an early warning system for serious cardiovascular issues. In one recently reported case, the Apple wearable actually provided better evidence of a condition than a hospital's own equipment.In a report published in the European Heart Journal on Wednesday and spotted by 9to5Mac, an 80-year-old woman attended the University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University, Germany, with what was described as "typical angina symptoms." The patient also advised of two praesyncopy episodes, a situation where a person almost loses consciousness due to reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the brain.Based on the presented details, and the female engineer's previous diagnosis of arterial hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and having had a pulmonary embolism two years prior, doctors performed an initial 12-channel ECG. The test didn't see any evidence for ischaemia, which is a restriction in blood vessels that can restrict the blood supply.Despite the hospital's own equipment not showing ischaemia, doctors were then convinced there was a related issue by the patient complaining about earlier ectopic beat episodes, which she recorded by using the ECG function of her Apple Watch. The recordings also included tracings with marked ST-segment depression, evidence that led to the medical team omitting further diagnostic measures in favor of treatment.In effect, the Apple Watch ECG recordings showed evidence of an issue that didn't appear in the hospital's specialized equipment, and successfully convinced doctors to treat the patient.The woman was transferred to a catheterization laboratory for a "left main stem stenosis and a left anterior descending/diagonal bifurcation lesion," and treatment with coronary artery stenting. The patient left the hospital the next day.It is suggested by the report that the Apple Watch "may be used not only to detect atrial fibrillation or atrioventricular-conduction disturbances but also to detect myocardial ischaemia."Current speculation for the Apple Watch Series 6 suggests the next generation of Apple Watch may include a feature for blood oxygen detection, as well as an upgraded ECG capable of working at higher heart rate ranges than the version introduced in the Apple Watch Series 4.AppleInsider has affiliate partnerships and may earn commission on products purchased through affiliate links.

One share of Amazon stock costs more than $1,700, locking out less-wealthy investors. So to continue its quest to democratize stock trading, Robinhood  is launching fractional share trading this week. This lets you buy 0.000001 shares, rounded to the nearest penny, or just $1 of any stock, with zero fee.The ability to buy by millionth of a share lets Robinhood undercut Square Cash’s recently announced fractional share trading, which sets a $1 minimum for investment. Robinhood users can sign up here for early access to fractional share trading. “One of our core values is participation is power,” says Robinhood co-CEO Vlad Tenev. “Everything we do is rooted in this. We believe that fractional shares have the potential to open up investing for even more people.”Fractional share trading ensures no one need be turned away, and Robinhood can keep growing its user base of 10 million with its war chest of $910 million in funding. As incumbent brokerages like Charles Schwab and E*Trade move to copy Robinhood’s free stock trading, the startup has to stay ahead in inclusive financial tools. In this case, though, it’s trying to keep up, since Schwab, Square, and SoFi all launched fractional shares this year. Stash has had them since 2015, and Betterment has actually offered this since 2010.Robinhood has a bunch of other new features aimed at diversifying its offering for the not-yet-rich. Today its Cash Management feature it announced in October isrolling out to its first users on the 800,000-person wait list, offering them 1.8% APY interest on cash in their Robinhood balance plus a Mastercard debit card for spending money or pulling it out of a wide network of ATMs. The feature is effectively a scaled-back relaunch of the botched debut of 3% APY Robinhood Checking a year ago, which was scuttled because the startup failed to secure the proper insurance it now has for Cash Management.Additionally, Robinhood is launching two more widely requested features early next year. Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) will automatically reinvest into stocks or ETF cash dividends Robinhood users receive. Recurring Investments will let users schedule daily, weekly, bi-weekly or monthly investments into stocks. With all this, and Crypto trading, Robinhood is evolving into a full financial services suite that will be much harder for competitors to copy.How Robinhood fractional shares work“We believe that if you want to invest, it shouldn’t matter how much money you have. With fractional shares, we’re opening up a whole universe of stocks and funds, including Amazon, Apple, Disney, Berkshire Hathaway, and thousands of others,” Robinhood product manager Abhishek Fatehpuria tells me.Users will be able to place real-time fractional share orders in dollar amounts as low as $1 or share amounts as low as 0.000001 shares rounded to the penny during market hours. Stocks worth over $1 per share with a market capitalization above $25 million are eligible, with 4,000 different stocks and ETFs available for commission-free, real-time fractional trading.“We believe that participation is power. Since day one, we’ve focused on breaking down barriers like trade commissions and account minimums to help people participate in the financial system,” says Fatehpuria. “We have a unique user base — half our customers tell us they’re first-time investors, and the median age of a Robinhood customer is 30. This means we have a unique opportunity to expand access to the markets for this new generation.”Robinhood is racing to corner the freemium investment tool market before other startups and finance giants can catch up. It opened a waitlist for its U.K. launch next year, which will be its first international market. But in just the past month, Alpaca raised $6 million for an API that lets anyone build a stock brokerage app, and Atom Finance raised $12.5 million for its free investment research tool that could compete with Robinhood’s in-app feature. Meanwhile, Robinhood suffered an embarrassing bug, letting users borrow more money than allowed.The move fast and break things mentality triggers new dangers when introduced to finance. Robinhood must resist the urge to rush as it spreads itself across more products in pursuit of a more level investment playing field.
French startup Yubo has raised a $12.3 million funding round led by Iris Capital and Idinvest Partners. Existing investors Alven, Sweet Capital and Village Global are also participating. The startup has managed to attract 25 million users over the years — there are currently tens of thousands of people signing up to the platform every day.Yubo  is building a social media app for young people under 25 with one focus in particular on helping teenagers meeting new people and creating friendships. Compared to the most popular social media apps out there, Yubo isn’t focused on likes and followers.Instead, the app helps you build your own tiny little community of friends. Yubo wants to become a familiar place where you belong, even if high school sucks for instance.More details in my previous profile of the company:In addition to meeting new people, you can start conversations and create live video streams to hang out together. Each stream represents a micro-community of people interacting through both video and a live chat.Since 2015, Yubo users have sent each other 10 billion messages and started 30 million live video streams. Overall, the user base has generated 2 billion friendships.Soon, users will be able to turn on screensharing to show something on their phones. And at some point in 2020, Yubo should release Yubo Web in order to expand Yubo beyond your smartphone and enable new use cases, such as video game live streaming.With today’s funding round, the company wants to attract users in new markets. Yubo is mostly active in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Nordic countries, Australia and France. Up next, the startup is going to focus on Japan and Brazil. The company plans to hire 35 new people.When it comes to a business model, the company started monetizing its app in October 2018 with in-app purchases to unlock new features. In 2019, the startup has generated $10 million in revenue.Yubo will also use this funding round to improve safety. It’s a never-ending process, especially when there are young people using your platform. The company already partners with Yoti for age verification. Users will soon be able to create a blocklist of certain words to customize their experience.In addition to continuous work on flagging tools and live-stream moderation algorithms in order to detect inappropriate content, the company will also increase the size of its moderation team. The company has also put together a safety board with Alex Holmes, Annie Mullins, Travis Bright, Mick Moran, Dr. Richard Graham and Anne Collier.
Chefclub hasn’t attracted a lot of headlines over the years as it has only raised $3.5 million. But it is slowly building a major media brand on social media platforms as it now competes directly with Tastemade and Tasty.Compared to more traditional recipe websites and brands, Chefclub  focuses exclusively on the intersection of food and entertainment. If you’ve watched a few Chefclub videos, your reaction is probably something along the lines of “oh no they didn’t.”You’ll see a lot of melted cheese, and somehow cooking often involves deep frying all the things. Some people around me are obsessed with those videos even though they’d never consider watching a cooking show on TV.“We are normal people, we don’t have the same cooking skillset that you can see on TV and in books. We opened up the kitchen cabinet and used everyday ingredients. That positioning has always been there and hasn’t changed,” Chefclub co-founder Thomas Lang told me.And it’s been working incredibly well. The company now has 75 million followers across multiple social media platforms. It generates a billion video views per month and reaches 200 million people. The startup has never spent a cent in paid media to grow this user base.Due to its lean culture, there are “only” 50 people working for Chefclub. The entire team is based in Paris, with one third of them who are not French. Despite this very French DNA, Chefclub has noticed that you don’t necessarily have to adapt all your content to different geographies. 70% of videos work well across the globe.Chefclub optimizes its content for Facebook first and foremost. As many publishers told me, it has become increasingly harder to work around Facebook’s algorithm to reach a large audience on Facebook. But the startup has been through all the ups and downs of Facebook’s algorithm. Those relentless efforts have been key to the company’s growth as many media brands simply gave up on Facebook.Other social networks seem way easier when you compare them to Facebook. Chefclub is now also active on YouTube, Snapchat (Discover partnership in France and Germany), Instagram and TikTok. The startup says that it is the leader in Europe and Latin America. In the U.S., the company is still in the growth phase — it is close to reaching 1 billion views in the U.S. in 2019.So how do you turn a successful media strategy into a business? Chefclub is betting heavily on the Direct-to-Consumer wave. The company first started with a recipe book. You can scan QR codes in the book to play the video on your phone. It has sold half a million cookbooks directly on its website.More recently, Chefclub has introduced Kiddoz, a cooking kit for kids. There’s a book with 20 recipes, easily identifiable measuring cups and an app.Up next, Chefclub wants to partner with retailers to license its brand and sell branded products. You could imagine buying Chefclub-branded appliances and toys in the near future.“We have another revenue source that we call ‘the cherry on the cake,’” Thomas Lang said. Chefclub generates revenue from preroll ads on YouTube and other social platforms with revenue-sharing deals. While this is not a focus, Chefclub gets $200,000 in ad revenue per month with no additional effort.Finally, Chefclub wants to open up content creation to community members. In order to scale its content, Chefclub wants to become a platform that broadcasts user-generated content to other community members.
A family in Mississippi claims a hacker gained access to a Ring camera placed in their 8-year-old daughter's room and started talking to her, say local reports.A video obtained by USA TODAY shows a view of the child's room while mysterious music starts playing from the Ring. A voice can also be heard saying "Hello there."During one clip, the voice is heard saying, "I'm your best friend. I'm Santa Claus."Another clip shows the voice encouraging the child to destroy her room. "You can do whatever you want right now," said the voice. "You can mess up your room. You can break your TV."Ashley LeMay and her husband then decided to disable the Ring camera."As soon as I got to the point where I heard like this person's voice, I knew something was terribly wrong," said LeMay during an interview with USA TODAY.LeMay said she bought the Ring camera during Black Friday at the advice of another mother. Four days after installing it, her daughter was confronted by the mysterious voice."My main thing was not knowing who it was, them having my home address and then them trying to gain my daughter's trust," said LeMay. "It almost made me feel like – and maybe I'm exaggerating – but it also made me worried that she could be kidnapped or anything like that." In a statement obtained by USA TODAY, Ring said the incident was not related to a breach or compromise of its security."Due to the fact that customers often use the same username and password for their various accounts and subscriptions, bad actors often re-use credentials stolen or leaked from one service on other services," said Ring's statement. "As a precaution, we highly and openly encourage all Ring users to enable two-factor authentication on their Ring account, add Shared Users (instead of sharing login credentials), use strong passwords and regularly change their passwords."LeMay said the family's Wi-Fi password is different from any other device she uses, and that they use a secure network."It's not to defend myself but just an effort to say that even if you have all those things, you are not 100% safe," said LeMay.This is not the first incident in which users of security cameras like Ring or Nest have experienced mysterious voices or sounds. Earlier this year, a California family said they heard an emergency warning from their Nest camera about three missiles from North Korea preparing to strike the U.S. Google, the parent company of Nest, said the incident happened because of a compromised password, not a direct hack of their system. Like Ring, Nest advises users to use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
Scientists have insisted the most vulnerable must remain protected.Some have suggested the "segmentation and shielding" approach would be most beneficial for getting the nation back to normality.This includes strengthening the shielding of society's most frail — including all over-70s and giving them added protection while relaxing measures for everyone else.Research suggests this would give young healthy adults and children greater freedoms while ensuring that the most vulnerable are protected. However, it has been reported that ministers now plan to ignore this advice.Today is was reported that ministers are planning to allow healthy over-70s be released from lockdown with the rest of the UK.Dr Bram van Bunnik, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Edinburgh's Usher Institute, said: "Easing the measures taken during the lockdown is important as they currently have a tremendous effect on our society, but this should only be done in a way that is both safe for the people that are most vulnerable as well as for the health and safety of NHS staff."Segmentation and shielding is a possible way of achieving this: measures could be eased for a large proportion of the population, however the vulnerable population likely still needs to be protected for a prolonged period."The model would ensure certain measures would stay in place.This includes the use of the NHSX contact-tracing app, social isolation upon expressing symptoms of COVID-19, quarantine of entire households and social distancing.However, it would allow society's fittest to slowly reclaim some of their lost freedoms.In contrast, a cabinet member told The Telegraph they would be "very surprised" if there was any tightening of the lockdown for the over-70s.The minister said: "The all over-70s grouping is going to morph."There is a big difference between the 1.5million "shielded" people, known as extremely critically vulnerable, who have been sent a letter advising them to shield for 12 weeks, vulnerable people with pre-existing conditions of any age, and healthy over-70s."This needs to be made clearer - you can't just have a blanket over-70s group, that's unsustainable."This comes as anxiety levels for over-70's have doubled amid the coronavirus lockdown according to new figures.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has shown that the elderly in the UK are no longer happier than their younger counterparts.The ONS said that the COVID-19 lockdown has had a massively negative effect on the over-70’s in the UK.Traditionally this age group is one of the happiest in the UK, with levels regularly higher than all ages below.The government body said: “Those aged 70 years and above reported being happier than those aged 16 to 69 years before the lockdown.“By the third week of lockdown, however, this gap had closed, so there was no significant difference in levels."Matt Hancock said last month older people would be "shielded for their own protection", meaning those aged 70 and over could be asked to stay at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the risk of the virus.The ONS continued: "The Government has advised the over-70s to be more stringent with social distancing measures and to ask friends, family and neighbours for support with essential supplies including food and medicine.“This could be leading to higher anxiety for this group." 
The Swedish activist Greta Thunberg changed her Twitter bio on Thursday in response to President Donald Trump's tweet mocking her win as Time magazine's Person of the Year and telling her she should "chill" and "work on her Anger Management problem."Thunberg was named Time magazine's 2019 Person of the Year this week after rising to international prominence as the face of youth climate activism. However, Thunberg's honor wasn't well received by everyone — particularly Trump, who was himself shortlisted for the award and didn't win."So ridiculous," Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. "Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"While Thunberg didn't respond with a tweet, she did make a timely update to her Twitter bio."A teenager working on her anger management problem" the 16-year-old's bio said. "Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend."Thunberg's bio previously described her as a "16 year old climate and environmental activist with Asperger's," according to the Wayback Machine archive.This isn't the first time that Trump has mentioned Thunberg on Twitter, or the first time that Thunberg has changed her Twitter bio in response.In September, after the climate activist said in a speech to the United Nations that the world was "in the beginning of a mass extinction," Trump mockingly tweeted that Thunberg was "looking forward to a bright and wonderful future." In turn, Thunberg changed her bio to "a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future."Trump's latest criticism of Thunberg drew fierce criticism online from those questioning Trump's use of Twitter to mock a 16-year-old with a developmental disability.Others referred to the uproar last month after a witness at the hearings in Trump's impeachment inquiry used the name of Trump's 13-year-old son, Barron, to make a pun about the president's constitutional power. Some were quick to call on first lady Melania Trump — who runs an anti-bullying campaign — to voice the same amount of outrage as she did after Barron's name was used.Some posited that Trump was jealous he wasn't awarded Time's honor, which he was shortlisted for this year alongside the Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.Trump was named Time's Person of the Year in 2016 shortly after he was elected, and he made headlines the following year when he claimed he turned down the chance to get the award again because Time told him he would only "probably" get it. Time denied that it did, and Trump's tweet about it has been widely mocked.That's not to mention that before winning the Time honor in 2016, framed fake Time covers edited to show Trump were spotted around his golf clubs.
(Reuters) - If the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passes articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate would hold a trial to determine whether he should be found guilty of the charges and removed from office.Here are the main players in what would be only the third such trial in U.S. history.CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTSA conservative who was appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, Roberts might find himself celebrating his 65th birthday on Jan. 27 by presiding over Republican Trump’s impeachment trial.Under the U.S. Constitution, the chief justice of the highest court is the referee in presidential impeachment trials.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has noted that if Roberts presides in a fashion similar to then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist in the 1999 trial of President Bill Clinton, he could allow any disagreements over procedures to be worked out by the senators themselves, probably through one or more Senate floor votes.But Roberts has been known to surprise court-watchers. For example, early this year he joined liberals in a 5-4 abortion case decision and did the same in a 2012 ruling upholding a central feature of Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law.SENATORS MITCH MCCONNELL AND CHUCK SCHUMERThe Senate majority and minority leaders, respectively, will be tasked with trying to reach a bipartisan deal over the rules governing any Trump trial.McConnell has raised the possibility of a trial that could consist only of arguments by House Democrats for conviction and by White House lawyers for acquittal, with no witnesses testifying.Schumer has called for a full and open trial. Each leader will have to weigh the pros and cons of any rank-and-file demands for witnesses.McConnell, a Republican, and Schumer, a Democrat, will likely wait until they see exactly what charges the House passes before getting down to serious negotiations.TRUMP’S LEGAL TEAMMuch like a trial held in the U.S. judicial system, the accused - in this case Trump - would be defended by a team of lawyers arguing for his acquittal.The White House has not yet announced who would spearhead this effort for Trump on the Senate floor.White House counsel Pat Cipollone would be expected to play a leading role. He has been working with deputies Patrick Philbin and Michael Purpura.Cipollone, a 53-year-old Republican, sent an eight-page letter to Congress in October laying out why the White House was refusing to cooperate with the House inquiry, calling it a “charade.”Trump lawyers are likely to argue that there is no evidence that the president did anything wrong and that the House investigation was partisan and flawed.HOUSE ‘MANAGERS’House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet named the Democratic “managers” who would prosecute the case against Trump in the Senate. But some obvious potential choices would be House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. They have been spearheading the impeachment effort in the House since Pelosi announced the start of a formal inquiry on Sept. 24.Pelosi likely would weigh several factors in choosing the managers, including their expertise on constitutional law, familiarity with details of the Trump impeachment case, as well as their oratorical eloquence.
First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then comes many discussions about how you should manage your finances as a couple. Getting married is a big life milestone and a great chance to take stock of your financial situation — that includes your credit cards.Below, CNBC Select answers some common questions about what happens to your credit when you get married.Will my credit report be merged with my spouse?No, your credit report isn’t merged with your spouse after marriage.“The credit bureaus don’t have a so-called ‘married credit report’ or anything like that,” John Ulzheimer, formerly of FICO and Equifax, tells CNBC Select. Your credit report is unique to you and will remain that way.Will I lose my credit history if I change my last name?No, changing your last name doesn’t erase your credit history.“When someone changes their last name, it is automatically added to their credit report after they notify their creditors of the new name. When the creditor updates their records, they report the new name to [the credit bureaus],” according to Experian’s website. “Applying for new credit using the new last name will also result in the name being added to the report.”After you officially change your name, inform your current creditors and make sure you use the new last name on future credit applications. Expect to still see your old last name on your credit report (in addition to your new last name), which is normal.Will my spouse’s bad credit affect me?It depends. It’s not likely your spouse’s bad credit score will have direct negative effects on your credit score (except in extreme circumstances, like if they rack up debt on your credit cards).“Because credit reports are stored and maintained at the individual consumer level, your spouse’s bad credit does not have influence over your credit reports and credit scores,” Ulzheimer says.But their score can affect your approval odds when you fill out joint applications for credit, such as a mortgage. Lenders review all applicants’ credit scores when they make their decision.“If you have good credit and your spouse has poor credit and you apply jointly, that can certainly have an impact on the application. The lender is going to consider your spouse’s poor credit which means your [interest] rates could be higher,” Ulzheimer explains.“The vice versa is true as well. If you have poor credit but your spouse has good credit, and you apply jointly, the result could be better terms than you would receive on your own.”Once you open a joint credit card (or any other shared financial product, such as a car loan), the positive and negative actions you and your spouse take will be reflected on both of your reports. As a good rule of thumb, have open conversations about how you’re both managing your money, so you can avoid negative consequences.Will I automatically be added to my spouse’s accounts?No, getting married doesn’t automatically add you to their financial accounts.If you want to become an authorized user on their credit card(s), you’ll need to initiate the process.Be aware that some credit cards charge a fee for authorized users. The Platinum Card® from American Express charges $175 annually for up to three additional Platinum Cards, $175 for each additional Platinum Card after the first three and $0 for additional American Express® Gold Cards.

NASA satellites have provided more data than ever before on what has been happening to Antarctica and Greenland's ice over the past 16 years with dire, if not entirely unexpected, findings. Both polar ice sheets are losing billions of tonnes of ice every year and adding to sea-level rise.The results revealed that although there are small gains of ice in East Antarctica, they have been dwarfed by massive losses in West Antarctica, NASA reported. The net ice mass loss has led to almost half an inch of sea-level rise between 2003 and 2019 - just under a third of the total sea-level rise around the world in that time.The findings were based on information from the space agency’s ICESat and ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeters - devices that use laser pulses to measure the elevation and thickness of ice sheets and help better understand global climate change.The researchers concluded that ice masses from both Greenland and Antarctica will continue to contribute to sea level rise increasing over the next few decades. Greenland’s ice sheet lost an average of 200 gigatons of ice per year, and Antarctica’s ice sheet lost an average of 118 gigatons of ice per year, NASA reported.One gigaton of ice would cover New York’s Central Park in ice more than 1,000 feet thick, to a height taller than the Chrysler Building, NASA said."Quantifying changes in Earth’s ice sheets, and identifying the climate drivers, is central to improving sea-level projections," the researchers stated.The researchers believe that "competing climate processes" are going on in the Antarctic. Antarctica and Greenland are losing ice mass overall, but it is accumulating in some regions while disappearing from others.In Greenland and Antarctica, "losses outpaced gains", with West Antarctica’s losses accounting for over 30 pr cent of the region’s total. It was somewhat compensated in East Antarctica, where ice sheets were gaining mass from accumulated snow.
North Korea fired gunshots at a South Korean guard post in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a buffer area which separates the two countries, on Sunday, and the South fired back, according to its military.The North Korean gunfire hit the wall but did not injure anyone or cause any discernible damage to the guard post or its equipment, said South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS). Several bullets from the North were fired into the DMZ at 7:41 a.m. local time Sunday, the JCS said in a text message to press.The South Korean military responded by broadcasting a verbal warning and returning fire twice, according to protocol outlined in the response manual and on the judgment of the field commander, according to the JCS statement. The South Korean military said that "the military is in the process of identifying situations over the military communication line with the North and preventing any additional situations from occurring."US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday that initial reports indicated the gunfire from the North was "accidental.""I've seen that reporting too. I've seen some of our internal information as well. We can confirm at least the initial reports are that you've described are just about right. A handful of shots that came across from the North. We think those were accidental. South Koreans did return fire so far as we can tell there was no loss of life on either side," Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's "This Week."Under the military accord signed between the two Koreas on September 29, 2018, the South and North each demolished 11 guard posts along the DMZ, but dozens of guard posts remain. There have been exchanges of fire between the Koreas in the past, including in 2017, when a North Korean solider defected at the JSA (Joint Security Area) and, in 2014, when a North Korean defector organization launched balloons of leaflets criticizing the country's reclusive regime.Pompeo was tight-lipped regarding North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who had not been seen publicly for weeks before images were shown Friday on state television of him at a fertilizer factory. During that period, Kim had missed an annual event held on April 15 honoring his grandfather."We don't know why he chose to miss that moment. We know there have been other extended periods of time where Chairman Kim's been out of public view as well so it's not unprecedented. ...We've seen the same images from yesterday that the world saw, looks like Chairman Kim is alive and well," Pompeo said."Regardless of any of that, our mission remains the same -- to convince the North Koreans to give up their nuclear weapons, to verify the same and to then create a brighter future for the North Korean people."Asked whether Kim was seriously ill during this period, Pompeo said: "I just can't say anything about that." He also refused to say whether the US had any information about whether Kim's situation was connected to Covid-19 or a heart issue.As recently as this past week, the US was monitoring intelligence suggesting Kim was in grave danger following a surgical procedure. National security adviser Robert O'Brien acknowledged the US was watching the situation closely on April 21.
This year's summer series of Love Island has been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, bosses have confirmed.ITV says the show will come back in 2021.The announcement has been made after much speculation about how the hit reality series, which usually airs in the UK in June, would go ahead due to the COVID-19 outbreak.Last week, ITV boss Kevin Lygo said he had ruled out filming in the UK rather than Majorca, after considering whether it could take place in Cornwall, and that he felt "uneasy" about airing a show that sees people "slathering over each other" while the rest of the nation is being told to socially distance.Now, it has been officially called off."We have tried every which way to make Love Island this summer but logistically it's just not possible to produce it in a way that safeguards the well-being of everyone involved and that for us is the priority," Mr Lygo said."In normal circumstances we would be preparing very soon to travel out to the location in Majorca to get the villa ready but clearly that's now out of the question."We are very sorry for fans of the show but making it safely is our prime concern and Love Island will be back stronger than ever in 2021."Host Laura Whitmore, who took over presenting duties from Caroline Flack for the first winter series earlier this year, said this year's series, set to be the seventh, had received more applications than ever."Like with a lot of things because of restrictions with travel, social distancing and unable to plan ahead, Love Island is postponed until 2021," she tweeted."Great news is that there have been more applications than any other series!"Next year is going to be BIG. Stay safe."Love Island has been a huge hit for ITV2 since its relaunch in 2015, and the first winter series, which was filmed in South Africa, launched in January.Whitmore had been confirmed as host for the winter show after Flack was charged with assault in December 2019.Flack later took her own life on 15 February, at the age of 40, just a few weeks before her trial was due to take place.Love Island paid tribute during the final episode of the latest series, which was won by Paige Turley and Finn Tapp.An inquest into her death is due to resume on 5 August. 
Some producers acknowledge the efforts are “just a drop in the bucket” of what farmers can’t sell and are destroying instead.While millions of Americans are worried about having enough to eat and lines at food banks grow, farmers have been plowing under vegetable fields, dumping milk and smashing eggs that cannot be sold because the coronavirus pandemic has shut down restaurants, hotels and schools.Now, the destruction of fresh food on such a scale has prompted action by the Trump administration and state governments, as well as grass-roots efforts like a group of college students who are renting trucks to rescue unsold onions and eggs from farms. But they most likely won’t be enough to address the problem if businesses remain closed for months.Over the next few weeks, the Department of Agriculture will begin spending $300 million a month to buy surplus vegetables, fruit, milk and meat from distributors and ship them to food banks. The federal grants will also subsidize boxing up the purchases and transporting them to charitable groups — tasks that farmers have said they cannot afford, giving them few options other than to destroy the food.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office has said New York will give food banks $25 million to buy products made from excess milk on farms in the state; the state is working with manufacturers like Chobani, Hood and Cabot to turn the milk into cheese, yogurt and butter. Some of the state subsidy can also be used to buy apples, potatoes and other produce that farms have in storage.Nationally, the Dairy Farmers of America, the largest dairy co-op in the United States, has diverted almost a quarter of a million gallons of milk to food banks.“It’s just a drop in the bucket,” said Jackie Klippenstein, a senior vice president at the co-op. “But we had to do something.”The closure of restaurants, hotels and school cafeterias wiped out huge sources of demand for fresh food, leaving farmers with millions of pounds of excess. While increased sales at grocery stores have made up for some of that, not since the Great Depression has so much fresh food been destroyed. (In the 1930s, the problem was that people could not afford to buy all the crops farmers were producing, which led the federal government to establish an early food stamp program.)The Agriculture Department grants are expected to be announced this week, but farmers say their losses far exceed what the grants can provide.“These are not insolvable problems,” said Marion Nestle, a food studies professor at New York University. “These are problems that require a lot of people, sums of money and some thought. If the government were really interested in making sure that hungry people got fed and farmers were supported, they would figure out a way to do it.”There are some signs that the waste is starting to dissipate. At the beginning of April, farmers were dumping 3.7 million gallons of milk each day, draining it into manure pits, where it mixed with fertilizer used in the fields. Now, the waste is closer to 1.5 million gallons, according to the dairy co-op, as farmers scale back production and restaurant chains like Papa John’s heed the industry’s call to add extra cheese to every pizza.Even as the waste declines for some food, other farmers are scrambling to find new buyers. California strawberry growers, for example, are reaching peak harvest season in May.“Time is not on our side," said Mary Coppola, a vice president at the United Fresh Produce Association, a trade group of fruit and vegetable growers and processors. “In my own personal opinion, we are not coming up with the supply-chain logistical solutions as quickly as produce is growing.”Some people, upset by all the food waste when families are running low, are trying to come up with other solutions.A group of university students have started an online site, FarmLink, seeking to connect farmers with food banks. James Kanoff at Stanford and Aidan Reilly at Brown founded the group last month with donations from family and friends.So far, it has diverted 50,000 onions that were about to be destroyed on a farm in Oregon and paid for their transportation to Los Angeles, where they were distributed to food banks. The students also bought 10,000 eggs from a California farm, rented a truck and drove them to a large food bank.FarmLink, which now includes about 20 students from several colleges, has been cold-calling hundreds of farms to find surpluses.“Just getting through to the farmers is the hardest part, because they are so busy,” said Jordan Hartzell, a Brown student.The need at food banks is only increasing as the economic crisis intensifies. There are still long lines outside many food banks, as the charities struggle with a surge in need and a scarcity of volunteers because of stay-at-home orders.While the details are being worked out, the New York subsidy may allow dairy companies like Chobani to drive trucks of their products into neighborhoods with the most need and hand them out in a public park.At the small food pantry she runs in Casper, Wyo., Mary Ann Budenske has seen shortages of staples like milk and eggs. On Thursday, a shipment of about 200 gallons of milk that arrived at 2:30 p.m. was half gone by 5. She has sent more than 20 emails to farmers and trade associations, offering to drive her 1998 Ford pickup truck to retrieve the leftover food herself.“Pretty much I’m getting the bureaucratic ‘We’re looking into that — we’ll get back in touch with you,’” Ms. Budenske said. “The whole thing makes me sick.”
An invasion of Asian giant hornets became the latest 2020 worry — and internet sensation — as the term "murder hornet" began to trend over the weekend.The first spotting of the 2-inch Asian giant hornet, or vespa mandarinia, was verified in the United States in December, according to the Washington state Agriculture Department. The insect does not generally target people or pets, but it is a deadly threat to at-risk honeybee hives.Giant hornets of this species apparently enter a "slaughter phase" during which they decapitate honeybees and destroy entire hives in the span of a few hours, according to the department.Although the species was first spotted months ago, the term "murder hornet" circulated on Twitter over the weekend after a New York Times report Saturday on efforts to stop the species from annihilating honeybees.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsAs the globe reels with the upheaval of normal life during the coronavirus pandemic, the internet latched onto "murder hornets" as yet another strange development of 2020.Recommended"Murder hornets. Sure thing, 2020," actor and comedian Patton Oswalt tweeted Saturday. "Give us everything. Hypno-frogs. Fecal blizzards. Toilet tsunamis. A CATS sequel. We can take it."An invasion could have severely negative impacts on the environment and public health, the Washington Agriculture Department warned.The species has longer stingers with more toxic venom that could pose a danger to people if the insects feel threatened. And unlike honeybees, the Asian giant hornets can sting repeatedly, entomologist Chris Looney said in a video posted to the department's YouTube page last month.Authorities are working to find nests and destroy them before they can reproduce, according to Looney.Looney warned people against trying to kill the hornets themselves and to avoid their nests entirely. Instead, the public is encouraged to report a possible sighting to local authorities.
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour Party said on Friday that talks with the government on a last-ditch Brexit deal had made no progress, as EU leaders said Prime Minister Theresa May had not convinced them that they should let Britain delay its departure next week.May wrote to Brussels asking European Union leaders to postpone Britain’s exit from next Friday until June 30. But they have insisted that she must first show a viable plan to secure agreement on her divorce deal in the deadlocked parliament.Labour, which she turned to reluctantly after failing three times to get her deal passed, said the government “has not offered real change or compromise” in three days of talks.“We urge the prime minister to come forward with genuine changes to her deal,” a statement said.Labour Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said his party wanted the talks to go on, and a spokesman for May’s office said the government had “made serious proposals” in the talks and wanted them to continue over the weekend “in order to deliver a deal that is acceptable to both sides”.May badly needs evidence of a viable divorce strategy to persuade the other 27 EU leaders at a summit next Wednesday to grant a delay, preferably on her preferred departure date.Any extension would require unanimous approval from the other EU countries, all weary of Britain’s Brexit indecision, and could come with conditions.“If we are not able to understand the reason why the UK is asking for an extension, we cannot give a positive answer,” said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. German Justice Minister Katarina Barley tweeted: “This playing for time must end.”Deep divisions in May’s Conservative Party and government, and in Labour, have led to a marathon of votes in parliament, in which scenarios ranging from abandoning the EU with no transition period to cancelling Brexit have all been defeated.Last Friday, May did the unthinkable by asking Labour to negotiate with her on a deal that might work for both - although some in Labour said she was luring the party into sharing responsibility for her failure.LETTER TO BRUSSELSHoping this would satisfy EU leaders, May wrote to EU summit chair Donald Tusk proposing a delay until June 30 at the latest, accepting that Britain might have to hold European Parliament elections on May 23, which she had hoped to avoid.“The government will want to agree a timetable for ratification that allows the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union before 23 May, 2019, and therefore cancel the European Parliament elections, but will continue to make responsible preparations to hold the elections should this not prove possible,” the letter said.So far, there has been little appetite in Brussels for an extension that could create another cliff edge in three months. May asked two weeks ago for a delay until June 30, only to be turned down.Tusk is planning to propose an extension of a year, which could also be shortened if Britain ratifies the withdrawal agreement, senior EU officials said.“The only reasonable way out would be a long but flexible extension. I would call it a ‘flextension’,” one official said.“It seems to be a good scenario for both sides, as it gives the UK all the necessary flexibility, while avoiding the need to meet every few weeks to further discuss Brexit extensions.”But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said May’s letter raised questions, adding: “We hope for more clarity from London before next Wednesday.”And France, which wants the EU to move on to other business including reforms proposed by President Emmanuel Macron, indicated it was not ready to accept any delay without a clear plan.“If we are not able to understand the reason why the UK is asking for an extension, we cannot give a positive answer,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters in Bucharest.SECOND REFERENDUM?Sterling fell against the U.S. dollar immediately after Labour’s comments and stood 0.5 percent down on the day.With time running out, it was not clear how Britain would avoid the abrupt “no-deal” departure that business leaders in Britain and also neighbouring Ireland say would cause huge disruption.Germany, as one of those with most to lose from a sudden dislocation of trade, has been one of those most tolerant of Britain’s turmoil.Justice Minister Barley tweeted that “there can only be an extension with a clear direction”, but also proposed a potential way out by adding: “This includes the question of a second referendum.”The idea of asking Britons - who voted by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU three years ago - to confirm or reject any divorce deal has been gaining ground in Britain.Yet May herself and many lawmakers in both main parties are strongly opposed, saying it would betray voters and undermine democracy, especially if it offered an option to stay in the EU.Both main parties made commitments after the referendum to deliver Brexit, but they never settled on a plan for how to leave or what future relationship to seek.May long insisted that her plan - quitting all EU institutions, with a 21-month standstill period to negotiate a bespoke free trade deal - was the only viable one. But it still split her cabinet and infuriated the most eurosceptic of her Conservatives.Labour wants closer ties than May has sought, including a customs union, which she has so far ruled out. Many Labour members of parliament insist that any agreement must be put to a second public vote.
An attack Thursday on two international oil tankers off the Iranian coast, which left one ship billowing black smoke and forced crews of both to abandon ship, was the work of Iran, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said."This is only the latest in a series of attacks instigated by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its surrogates against American and allied interests," Pompeo said.No nation or group claimed responsibility for the attack, the second on oil tankers in the region in a month.Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei expressed "concern and sorrow" over the incident, saying other nations would benefit from instability in the region.The U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet said it received two distress calls and sent the guided-missile destroyer USS Bainbridge to the scene."Twenty-one mariners from the M/V Kokuka Courageous, who abandoned ship, were rescued and are currently aboard Bainbridge," the Navy said in a statement."Today's attacks are a clear threat to international freedom of navigation and freedom of commerce," Capt. Bill Urban, lead spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a Thursday night statement. "The U.S. and the international community, stand ready to defend our interests, including the freedom of navigation."Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency initially claimed its nation's search-and-rescue teams picked up the 21 sailors aboard the Kokuka Courageous and the 23 from the Front Altair and evacuated them to the nearby Iranian port of Jask. Iranian TV later aired video of some sailors gathered in a room watching TV.Inside Iran: Anger, weariness, wonderment as Trump reimposes sanctionsFrontline, the firm that operates the Front Altair, said an explosion caused the fire. Its crew of 23 was safely evacuated to the nearby Hyundai Dubai vessel, it said.BSM Ship Management said the Kokuka Courageous sustained hull damage.Japan’s Trade Ministry said the vessels had “Japan-related cargo.” The incident took place as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wrapped up a visit to Tehran aimed at improving relations between Iran and the United States.Pompeo said Iranian officials refused Abe's overtures, then attacked ships carrying goods. Jamal Abdi, president of the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, urged Iran, the United States and other nations to show restraint while the investigation unfolds."The fact that the sabotage occurred amid Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s state visit to Iran underscores that the likely motive of the attackers is to prevent any easing of tensions and block off exit ramps to war," Abdi said.James Piazza, a Penn State political science professor specializing in the Islamic world, told USA TODAY that although hard-line elements in Iran could be involved, Iran-allied rebels in Yemen are also among suspects.A picture obtained by AFP from Iranian State TV IRIB on June 13, 2019 reportedly shows smoke billowing from a tanker said to have been attacked off the coast of Oman, at un undisclosed location. The crews of two oil tankers were evacuated off the coast of Iran today after they were reportedly attacked and caught fire in the Gulf of Oman, sending world oil prices soaring. The mystery incident, the second involving shipping in the strategic sea lane in only a few weeks, came amid spiralling tensions between Tehran and Washington, which has pointed the finger at Iran over tanker attacks in May. Iran said its navy had rescued 44 crew members after the two vessels caught fire in "accidents" off its coast.

The price began to go down later in the day. Last year, President Donald Trump withdrew from an accord between Iran and world powers aimed at limiting Tehran's nuclear capabilities. The White House has repeatedly claimed that Iran threatens American forces and facilities in the Middle East. Last month, Trump dispatched the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and a bomber task force to the region.BSM Ship Management, owner of the Kokuka Courageous, said it launched a "full-scale emergency response following a security incident." One crew member was slightly injured, the company said.The Courageous, stranded 16 miles off the coast of Iran and 80 off the United Arab Emirates, was in no danger of sinking, BSM said.Taiwan's state oil refiner CPC chartered the Front Altair, which carried 75,000 tons of the petrochemical naphtha, when it was "suspected of being hit by a torpedo," Wu I-Fang, CPC's petrochemical business division CEO, told Reuters news agency.The attack Thursday drew parallels to a similar attack last month off the coast of the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia said in May that four oil tankers were sabotaged, which caused "significant damage" to the vessels. One of the ships was en route to pick up Saudi oil to take to the USA.“It's going to be a bad problem for Iran if something happens, I can tell you that," Trump said after that incident. "They're not going to be happy." An investigation blamed explosive sea mines, and Saudi Arabia and the United States blamed Iran. Iran denied involvement, although Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen have launched missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia.
Hulu  today is launching a new kind of ad experience that allows brands to specifically target binge-watchers — that is, viewers who are watching multiple episodes of a favorite program over a long stretch of time. These “binge watch ads” utilize machine learning techniques to predict when a viewer has begun to binge watch a show, then serves up contextually relevant ads that acknowledge a binge is underway. This culminates when the viewer reaches the third episode, at which point they’re informed the next episode is ad-free or presents a personalized offer from the brand partner.The binge watch ad concept was first announced at Hulu’s annual NewFronts presentation in May, where it introduces to advertisers its new shows, features and ad formats. The company regularly experiments with new advertising formats designed to better cater to a streaming audience in a less obtrusive way. For example, Hulu already offers “pause ads,” which only appear when the viewer presses the pause button.Hulu says it made sense to target binge watchers because binging is now such a common way for people to watch their favorite shows. Today, 75% of U.S. consumers say they binge watch, and on Hulu specifically, nearly 50% of ad-supported viewing hours are spent during binge watch sessions. Hulu defines a “binge” as a viewer watching three or more episodes of a series at a given time.The debut advertisers to capitalize on the new binge watch ad format include Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific, by way of Hulu’s exclusive launch agency partner, Publicis Media.Kellogg’s will promote Cheez-It Snap’d snacks during their binge ads, while Georgia Pacific will tout its Sparkle paper towels. Marker’s Mark, of course, will promote its bourbon.The brands say they were interested in the new format because it gives them a way to reach and reward the consumer during a marathon entertainment session, and because it’s a better fit with how today’s consumers watch TV. Thanks to the rise of ad-free subscription video services like Netflix, viewers are less receptive to disruptive advertising that interrupts their viewing. In fact, they can even sour on a brand when its ad plays repeatedly throughout the viewing session.Offering brands the ability to sponsor an episode, ad-free, instead creates more positive sentiments among viewers.Hulu’s focus on developing new ad formats that better fit how today’s consumers watch TV may give it an advantage over rivals. Its ad-supported product is now one of many options for streaming TV — and one that goes up against a number of free services, including The Roku Channel, Amazon’s IMDb TV, Sinclair’s Stirr, Viacom’ s Pluto TV, Tubi, YouTube, Vudu’s Movies on Us (Walmart), Plex and others.
Amid rising confirmed coronavirus case counts, and a death toll that has begun to plateau, President Donald Trump spent much of Sunday lashing out at politicians, attacking the media, and bragging about his poll numbers. He also seemed to suggest Covid-19 is a cosmic or biblical force — and one that has already been stopped.Sunday morning, the president panned former President George W. Bush’s recent call for bipartisan unity in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, arguing his predecessor should have spoken up on his behalf during Trump’s impeachment process.“Let us remember how small our differences are in the face of this shared threat,” Bush said Saturday in a video message to the public. “In the final analysis, we are not partisan combatants.”Trump felt this was inappropriate, however, quoting comments made by Pete Hegseth, a weekend cohost of Fox & Friends, who asked “where [Bush] was during impeachment calling for putting partisanship aside.” To this, Trump added, “He was nowhere to be found in speaking up against the greatest Hoax in American history!”After sending out the tweet about Bush, Trump proceeded to send out one adversarial and divisive post after another.He deemed NBC and CNN “Chinese puppets who want to do business there” and “the enemy of the people.” He boasted about his approval ratings among Republicans and said that a new Gallup poll shows “Trump beating Sleepy Joe Biden.” (It does not.) He said there were “many complaints coming in” over Maine’s coronavirus response (despite the state government’s rising approval ratings) — and then added that he won the state. He also retweeted some of his old tweets, one in which he declared a video of a boat owner who painted Trump’s name onto his boat “very cool,” and another in which he falsely claims Democrats want “OPEN BORDERS.”He capped off his spree with a tweet about America coming together as a nation — and it was an odd one, in which he described an America rising from the “death and destruction” caused by “a great and powerful Plague” that led to “lost souls all over the World:”Trump’s tone in the tweet, which didn’t seem to have any obvious contextual explanation, was roundly mocked on social media by his critics. “Camus wept,” quipped Charles Pierce, a politics writer for Esquire. Talking Points Memo founder Josh Marshall tweeted, “tfw you try to bible-speak on twitter.”The tweet appeared to suggest the danger posed by the coronavirus had largely passed, given that it was all written in the past tense, but with its biblical language also seemed to place blame for the virus on some force greater than Trump himself, and one that he didn’t have control over.While it is true that the coronavirus is believed to have come from nature, in reality, Trump has botched countless opportunities to fight against the virus. Among many other things, he downplayed its dangers, dismantled the bureaucratic expertise required to manage a pandemic, refused to swiftly take steps to provide Americans with protective gear and medical equipment, and conditioned aid to states on political favors.These latest tweets have come during a period of heavy Twitter activity by the president. In general, Trump appears to tweet more when he feels under siege and wants to push back against particular narratives or Democratic attacks that undermine his reputation. Given that Trump is constantly under fire these days for his catastrophic mismanagement of the American coronavirus response, it’s not exactly surprising that he took to Twitter to unleash a wave of attacks.ù
Britain has only met two of the Government's five key tests that must be passed before the coronavirus lockdown can be lifted, a top advisor admitted today.The deputy chief medical officer for England, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, said there remained 'challenges' to be overcome before the tick list could be completed.His announcement came just days before the lockdown is due to be reviewed, and Boris Johnson pushed back the timing of his exit plan by days.Speaking at the daily Downing Street news conference Prof Van-Tamm said that the first two tests, making sure the NHS is not overwhelmed and a sustained fall in deaths, had been achieved.Britain's daily coronavirus death toll today rose by 288 - the lowest 24-hour jump since the end of March, as figures show the UK's crisis is continuing to slow down after peaking in mid-April.But the news on the final three was less reassuring.He said: 'The next one is solid information that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels right across the board. This is an indicator that we need to keep a close eye on  over the next few days and weeks.'The fourth one is around operational challenges around testing and PPE and being able to meet future demand. 'There are continuing challenges on PPE. It's an absolute priority to keep pushing on this, to get it right in the long-run. But of course on testing .... we are in a very good position.'On the fifth, being confident the NHS can withstand a second peak of cases, he added: 'This is really a matter of deep scientific discussion - very, very close following and absorbing of the evidence and one that we are keeping under detailed scientific review as the days and the weeks go by.'His analysis came as Nicola Sturgeon today dismissed the prospect of any 'meaningful' change to lockdown this week. The Scottish First Minister declared at a briefing in Edinburgh that the situation is so delicate the curbs cannot be significantly eased.She also promised to set out her own proposals for how to ease the curbs tomorrow - nearly a week before the PM is expected to unveil his strategy. The latest brazen example of Ms Sturgeon gazumping the Westminster government came amid signs the two-metre social distancing rules could be softened to help revive the economy.The shape of the 'road map' has started to emerge, with a leaked draft suggesting it will recognise that keeping gaps between workers is not always possible.Instead companies will be advised they can take other precautions such as installing screens and imposing strict hygiene procedures.Meanwhile, offices will be told to overhaul their rotas to minimise risks by staggering arrival, break and departure times, ending hot desking and avoiding sharing equipment.Ministers confirmed this morning that the government has started stockpiling face masks for public use.   The PM is expected to unveil the exit strategy in an address to the nation on Sunday, having delayed the announcement by three days as frantic work continues in Whitehall. The law requires that a decision on extending the lockdown measures be taken by Thursday, but ministers could have initial results from a huge surveillance project to assess the prevalence of the disease by the end of the week. In a video posted on the Downing Street Twitter feed today, Mr Johnson warned that the 'worst thing' the country could do right now is 'ease up too soon' while there is still a threat of a 'second peak'.  'We will only be able to move onto the second phase of this conflict if our five tests have been met,' he said.The tests are: that the NHS must have sufficient critical care capacity; there must be a sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths; the infection rate must be decreasing to 'manageable levels'; there must be enough PPE and testing supply; and any adjustments must not lead to a second peak which could overwhelm the health service.Mr Johnson said: 'The worst thing we could do now is ease up too soon and allow a second peak of coronavirus.' Ministers have been under massive pressure to set out the way forward, with the draconian current curbs estimated to be costing the country £2billion a day.The obstacles have been underlined with unions threatening to block plans to get rail services up to 85 per cent of usual levels within a fortnight. Furious Tory MPs accused the RMT of trying to exploit the situation to get more money for their members. Downing Street stressed that current guidance was for people to maintain the two metres gap 'where possible'.  In other developments in the coronavirus crisis At her daily briefing in Edinburgh today, Ms Sturgeon said that, although 'real and significant progress' was being made, the rate of reproduction of the virus was still too high to alleviate lockdown measures.She said it is 'likely' that lockdown measures will continue without any 'meaningful' changes.'Although we are making real and significant progress ... the numbers still eing infected by the virus and the all-importnat R number remain too high right now to make any meaningful change without risking the virus running out of control again,' she said.  Saying she expected to unveil her own exit plan tomorrow, Ms Sturgeon said work would be done to ensure there was alignment with the rest of the UK, but divergence in measures could still be possible. The First Minister also outlined the Scottish Government's test, trace, isolate (TTI) strategy, which she said would aid the easing of the lockdown measures.Ms Sturgeon said the strategy would only work if the public adheres to it, adding it was not a 'quick fix or magic solution' and would need to be done alongside current hygiene guidance.Ms Sturgeon said moves were being made to deliver a TTI strategy by the end of May, with testing capacity expected to have to rise to 15,500 per day to support the approach.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace hinted that social distancing advice will be fleshed out, telling Sky News that that protective screens and ensuring people were not close together for very long could reduce the need for strict distancing. 'You can look at shielding, you can look at how long you stay near people. The two-metre rule reduces the possibility of infection by a certain amount of time,' he said.'If you halve that it still keeps people away from being infected but for a lesser time. The probability of being infected is much less.'I think there are options about how we can do it. You can wear PPE, that could be a possibility if you have to be in close proximity or indeed you could find other ways of doing it.'He pointed towards supermarket workers working behind 'shields'. Mr Wallace also confirmed that the government is stockpiling face masks in case it decides to change its advice - something that has already happened in Scotland. Mr Johnson has said they will be 'useful' in the next phase of lockdown but the Westminster guidance has not been updated, 'It's not the amazing thing if you wear a mask that no one's going to get it but there is obviously this issue about human nature and interactions if you go on public transport and wear a mask will you feel able to go back to work,' Mr Wallace said.'At the same time, to anticipate should different rules be made around masks we're trying to source as many masks as possible as we speak and have been for the last few weeks.'Sir Jeremy Farrar, a SAGE member and head of the Wellcome Trust, said there was 'nothing magical' about the two metre advice, and it was based on long-standing evidence about how far coughs and sneezes were likely to travel.'There is nothing magical about two metres,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'Perhaps more importantly is the time you spend near someone else.'  The draft guidance, a version of which has been leaked to the BBC and Financial Times.It suggested vulnerable staff - such as those aged over 70, pregnant, with underlying health conditions or pregnant - should be put in the 'safest possible roles'.The guidance is clear that anyone who can work from home should continue to do so - meaning many staff will be out of the office for months to come.  But the draft does not spell out what action should be taken on PPE - saying merely that more information will follow. Some businesses fear they might be open to legal action from staff if they loosen the rules without clear direction from the government. Mr Wallace played down concerns that 'coronaphobia' could hamper efforts to get the economy running again, with polls showing significant numbers would be nervous about returning to work.The Defence Secretary said: 'I strongly believe the public aren't stupid. They read advice, they listen to the media.'They took on board the Government's advice... and I think they will be perfectly able to read the Government's next stage when we get to it.'I'm totally confident when it comes to the next step we will all together be able to move forward.' Mr Johnson will describe the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine as the 'most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes' later as he calls on nations to 'pull together' in response to the pandemic.The Prime Minister is expected to tell an online pledging conference - co-hosted by the UK and eight other countries and organisations - that the sooner states share their expertise the faster scientists will succeed in defeating the disease.It comes as Mr Johnson revealed he feared he would not live to see his baby son Wilfred born when he battled Covid-19 in intensive care last month.The PM will tell the conference, which aims to bring in more than £6.6billion in funding, that the race to develop a vaccine is 'not a competition between countries but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes'.'It's humanity against the virus - we are in this together and together we will prevail,' he is expected to say.Coronavirus has claimed more than 246,000 lives around the world, according to analysis by John Hopkins University.A total of 28,446 people have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Saturday. Meanwhile, the government is facing fresh pressure over testing, after the daily number slumped to 76,496 - below the 100,000 target. Cabinet minister Michael Gove told the daily Downing Street press conference last night: 'Ultimately, unless and until we have a vaccine then I suspect that we are going to have to live with some degree of constraint because of the nature of the virus.'But we obviously want to, wherever possible, and consistent with the measures on public health, restore people's lives to as close to normal as possible.'He said the Government will pursue a 'phased approach' to removing lockdown restrictions rather than a sudden return to 'the old normal' - and that the easing had to be done in a 'cautious fashion'.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson faces a backbench rebellion over his Government's 'absurd, dystopian and tyrannical' coronavirus lockdown today.Furious Tory MPs including 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady and ex-Brexit ministers David Davis and Steve Baker are preparing to voice anger over the extent of the enforced shut-down. They will argue that the economic, social and health costs of the self-imposed paralysis of UK PLC is so great that it must be eased. They will use a debate on the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) Regulations brought in in March, which gave ministers and police the greatest swathe of restrictive powers ever granted in peacetime.As well as measures to unclog the stagnant economy there are civil liberties concerns about the new NHS contact tracing app and the way it tracks the public.Mr Johnson is expected to announce measures to allow the lockdown to be eased in an address to the nation on Sunday, after it is officially extended for three more weeks on Thursday.But Mr Baker, a former Brexit 'Spartan' who is no stranger to going contrary to his front bench, said 'whatever the necessities, that the rule of law should have been overthrown in this period is extraordinary and deeply troubling,' in an article for the Daily Telegraph.'Millions of people in our country have been plunged into idleness at public expense and unemployment, facing financial and psychological hardship on a scale never seen before,' he added.''Thousands of people have missed life-prolonging health appointments. Vulnerable people are isolated and domestic violence has soared. Soon will come the full economic impact on all our lives.'He went on: 'This is absurd, dystopian and tyrannical. The sooner it is ended, the better.' Mr Johnson today warned that lifting lockdown restrictions too soon would be 'the worst thing we could do'.In a video message on Twitter, the Prime Minister said it was important to meet the five tests set by the Government before easing the lockdown. Mr Davis, who has a long history of speaking out on civil liberties issues, is preparing to challenge the Government over its new contact tracing app, which is due to start trials on the Isle of Wight this week.
