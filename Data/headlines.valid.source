Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, who President Trump nominated as Director of National Intelligence, said during his confirmation hearing Tuesday that he didn't know what the term "deep state" meant.Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., had asked Ratcliffe about President Trump's allegation that members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies had sought to "undermine his administration.""President Trump has repeatedly, and without any basis in my view, accused the hardworking men and women of the IC [intelligence community] of working to undermine his administration," Heinrich told Ratcliffe before asking, "Do you think -- do you believe that there is 'deep state' in the IC?""I don't know what that means ... I don't know what that is," Ratcliffe responded. Heinrich followed by asking whether it would be inappropriate or illegal to "remove, or reassign, [or] to screen or otherwise discriminate against career IC personnel for political reasons.""Yes," Ratcliffe responded.FBI DISCUSSED INTERVIEWING MICHAEL FLYNN 'TO GET HIM TO LIE' AND 'GET HIM FIRED,' HANDWRITTEN NOTES SHOWRatcliffe's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly denounced the "deep state" during his term of office and accused members of law enforcement and the intelligence community of harboring bias towards him and his administration.The issue came up again last week when internal FBI documents showed top bureau officials openly questioned whether their goal in interviewing then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in January 2017 was "to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired."The documents fueled suspicions that the Russia investigation was tainted by political motives and put the spotlight back on top FBI conterintelligence official Peter Strzok, who was one of the agents who interviewed Flynn. Strzok and his mistress, Lisa Page, created a media firestorm when they were removed from the FBI's Russia investigation after it was revealed that their text messages included disparaging comments about Trump. 
The crowds weren’t just equipped for a storm, they were counting on one. When rain started to fall on the tens of thousands of mostly young people amassed around Hong Kong’s legislature on the morning of June 12, umbrellas popped open with loud shouts of “Ga yau!” — a Cantonese cheer meaning “Add oil,” as to a fire. Within hours, the flimsy canopies were flipped sideways and turned into makeshift shields against tear gas and pepper spray fired by local police. They proved less reliable against rubber bullets, however, and might offer no protection at all against the authoritarian forces that loom over the entire island.But the point was to try.The protests were hardly the first in the former British colony since it was handed over to China in 1997. The specter of greater control by communist authorities on the mainland had driven Hong Kongers onto the streets in 2003, 2012 and 2014. But this time, the numbers were greater than ever before and the escalation carried at least the sense of a showdown.The specific issue at hand was a bill that would allow the extradition of fugitives to stand trial in mainland China. The legislation, fast-tracked by the city’s leadership, is widely seen as a threat to the unique freedoms this city of 7 million enjoys. Under the terms of the handover, Hong Kong has operated under a customized model called “one country, two systems,” which gave it a 50-year period of effective self-rule, even though it is part of China. Its history as a lucrative colonial port town left a liberal legacy unique in the People’s Republic.Hong Kongers have long lived a freer, more cosmopolitan lifestyle than most Chinese, and prejudice against mainlanders is pervasive. Free speech and an independent press are enshrined in the Basic Law that has governed the city since the handover. They’re proud of their distinct cuisine and language, speaking Cantonese rather than the Mandarin more common in greater China.But critics fear that China’s encroachment may bring an end to all that. Beijing might use the law to nab opponents and submit them to its notoriously opaque justice system, they say. The risk could extend beyond residents, even to visitors who pass through the city’s transit hub. “If Hong Kong’s extradition bill becomes law,” says Sean King, a former U.S. diplomat in Asia and currently senior vice president for the consultancy firm Park Strategies, “I’d think very carefully about visiting again anytime soon.”In other words, the contest for Hong Kong reflects the stakes for the larger world that China seeks to lead.The rise of Beijing has been the major global story of the new century. But the very breadth of that ascent and the bland labels of the areas where it has edged toward dominance — trade, infrastructure, finance, tech — have served to mask the nature of the system China brings with it. That system is control.On the mainland, the system appears to go unchallenged, because control is almost total and cast as conformity. Along with a surveillance state, China’s Communist Party has worked to impose a singular vision of Chinese identity in territories where diversity once thrived. In the far western province of Xinjiang, authorities have detained more than a million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in concentration camps where they are forced to adopt secular Chinese customs. In Tibet, the party is systematically erasing a rich Buddhist heritage. President Xi Jinping has revived nationalism as a unifying force, in step with a rising tide of authoritarians around the globe that U.S. President Donald Trump has in many cases embraced.Now it appears to be Hong Kong’s turn to feel the heat of a greater power forcing it into conformity — but China’s freest city won’t give in without a fight. Hong Kong has a long history of mass demonstrations. Significantly, just days before the protests erupted, it was host to one of the largest-ever vigils for the victims of Beijing’s bloody 1989 crackdown on democracy activists at Tiananmen Square. It’s the only place on Chinese soil where the massacre is openly commemorated, while government censors try to wipe it from mainland memory. The spirit of the protests snuffed out 30 years before helped inflame the demonstrations seen in Hong Kong.“We’re furious, we’re angry, some of us are afraid — but we’re here anyway,” says Laurie Wen, a 48-year-old writer who joined this month’s protests. “The thing that infuriates us the most is pointing to the sky during the day and calling it night.”Read more: ‘I’m in Prison Because I Fought For My City’s Freedom. Hong Kong’s Extradition Law Would be a Victory for Authoritarianism Everywhere’Hong Kong’s fresh wave of civil disobedience began with a murder. In February 2018, a pregnant 20-year-old woman from Hong Kong was killed by her boyfriend during a trip to Taiwan. The suspect, Chan Tong-kai, then 19, flew back to Hong Kong and has since been jailed for lesser crimes. Unable to prosecute the Hong Kong resident for a murder beyond the city’s jurisdiction and without legal grounds to send him to Taiwan, the city’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, pushed for a bill that would allow Chan to be extradited.But the legislation raised alarm bells. Hong Kong’s courts and Lam would have the authority to transfer suspects to jurisdictions with which the territory has no extradition agreement — not just Taiwan but also mainland China. This presents a threat not just to criminals but potentially to anyone whose behavior offends the Communist Party leadership, from human-rights advocates to business executives.That helps explain why an unusually diverse assemblage of lawyers, students, stay-at-home moms, business-people and others joined the protests against what they see as an existential assault on their rights. On Sunday, June 9, a two-mile stretch of a central avenue was filled with column after column of protesters in a uniform of plain white T-shirts. From above, the mass of slow-moving city dwellers looked like a giant snake sliding through a forest of skyscrapers and wrapping its jaws around Hong Kong’s legislative headquarters.If the estimates are even close to accurate, the march was the largest protest in the city’s history; organizers say more than a million people — one-seventh of the population — flooded the streets with chants of “No extradition to China!” and “Carrie Lam, step down!”The reality is, China already feels empowered to grab its adversaries from Hong Kong soil. In 2015, five book-sellers peddling salacious volumes about mainland politics disappeared; all five eventually resurfaced in China. In 2017, a Chinese tycoon was abducted by secret police from one of the city’s luxury hotels. But the extradition bill would render what are now noteworthy exceptions into something entirely routine; if the option to legally extradite people is on the table, Beijing will use it, critics say.Chinese officials have spoken out in full support of the legislation, but Lam steadfastly denies that the amendments were Beijing’s idea. “This bill was not initiated by the central people’s government. I have not received any instruction or mandate from Beijing,” Lam told reporters at a press conference on June 10. “We were doing it, and we are still doing it, out of our clear conscience and our commitment to Hong Kong.”Though Lam’s critics describe her as a “puppet” of the mainland, her protests illustrate the importance of maintaining at least the pretense of independence. The Hong Kong government is still haunted by the massive protests of 2003, which forced it to back down on national-security legislation outlawing sedition and criticism of the Chinese government. Scrapping the bill was perceived as an admission that the government knew it was wrong, and Lam is fearful a repeat would destroy both Beijing’s trust in her loyalty and her legitimacy at home. The last time Hong Kongers took to the street in great numbers, in the 2014 student-led occupation of the financial district that became known as the Umbrella Movement, the authorities here and in Beijing refused to grant concessions. Many student leaders were jailed, and some remain behind bars. If Lam gives in now, Hong Kong will have proved that throngs in the street still have currency in the final free enclave of China.This time, unlike in 2014, the protests have taken on a more violent tenor. On the streets, clashes broke out after some demonstrators hurled bricks and bottles at police. The first clouds of tear gas exploded into the crowds just before 4 p.m. on June 12, sending panicked protesters and journalists fleeing for the safety of malls and parking garages. But the demonstrators are defiant, vowing to defy the government until the legislation is dead in the water.The business and diplomatic communities have answered the call to support them. More than 100 local businesses committed to joining a labor strike on June 12 — an extremely rare event in Hong Kong — fearing the law could even endanger investors and government employees transiting through Hong Kong.The government has already shown itself willing to punish private companies for offending Beijing; last year, Financial Times journalist Victor Mallet was denied a working visa after chairing a talk by a pro-independence activist.Protest leaders have shown no sign of backing down. “We ask everyone to continue staying here to support the demonstration,” Claudia Mo, a lawmaker with the pro-democracy Civic Party yelled to cheering crowds shortly before they were dispersed. “During Occupy Central in 2014, we said, ‘We will be back.’ Today, we say, ‘We are back!’”The rift between Beijing and Hong Kong has now been widening for 22 years, and every attempt by the central government to bring Hong Kong further into its fold has triggered panic and protest. This in turn has deepened Beijing’s distrust of Hong Kong, which it sees as disloyal and subject to foreign interference.News about the latest protests is being heavily censored in China, where state-controlled newspapers have blamed the unrest on “foreign forces” meddling in Hong Kong’s affairs — but experts say it is China’s own interference that may be further alienating its rogue territory.“By forcing the issue in such an aggressive and abrupt way,” says James Millward, a professor of history at Georgetown University, “China can actually be creating a population in Hong Kong that will dig in and actually redefine itself in opposition to the mainland even more than it has so far.”That risks putting the two sides on a more overt collision course. At best, more sustained opposition to Beijing will lead to political deadlock. At worst, it could lead to punishment in whatever form it deems fit.Beijing’s tolerance of Hong Kong ultimately comes down to a cost-benefit analysis, and the city may be becoming more trouble than it’s worth. In 1993, four years before the handover, the coastal enclave was China’s cash cow — a financial gateway between East and West. At the time, the city accounted for roughly 27% of China’s GDP. But 26 years later, the mainland is awash in mercantile centers made in its own image and Hong Kong accounts for only about 2.9% of the Chinese economy.“Uncomfortably for Hong Kongers, and everyone who loves Hong Kong, the city finds itself on the front lines of a global battle between a resurgent Chinese Communist Party and a world that adheres to liberal democratic values,” says Ben Bland, director of the Southeast Asia Project at the Lowy Institute and author of Generation HK: Seeking Identity in China’s Shadow. “The systems maintained by these two blocs are incompatible when pressed up against each other.”Hong Kong’s freedoms currently allow it to fight back in ways that other parts of China can’t, but for how long? The state is becoming only more pervasive. -Xinjiang is seen by many as a laboratory for wider application of invasive surveillance. Human-rights groups have reported police methods for harvesting data from Xinjiang residents from phones and ID cards and using it to track and detain supposed threats to public order. “Many people think that Hong Kong may be the next place where it gets rolled out,” says Millward of Georgetown. In the meantime, the memory of Tiananmen — where public protest was ultimately met with tanks and fusillades — is as vivid as it is chilling in Hong Kong.Like many youths who joined the latest protests, high school student Rachel Liu grew up in a political state scheduled to expire within her lifetime. At 15 years old, she’s tasted the freedom that Hong Kong offers and is afraid of the change an increasingly authoritarian Beijing will bring to the only home she knows. “There are so many officials in China, and they have so much power,” she said. “Even if this amendment doesn’t pass, there will be other amendments, other laws in the future that will bring Hong Kong more and more under China’s control. There’s nothing more important than this movement right now.” — With reporting by Laignee Barron, Aria Chen, Amy Gunia, Abhishyant Kidangoor and Hillary Leung/Hong Kong and Charlie Campbell/Shanghai
We’ve all heard them — the blaring alerts that activate our cellphones or television when a severe weather warning is issued.Perhaps our favorite weather app sent us a push notification, or we saw a television meteorologist pointing at vibrant boxes on a weather map. Whatever the medium, weather warnings have a way of finding us, especially whenever a severe thunderstorm is close by. Now those warnings, specifically the way in which they’re generated, are in the process of getting a makeover.Severe weather warnings are issued for individual thunderstorms; before 2007, entire counties would be alerted at once. Over the years, weather warnings have become more targeted — but one warning can still cover an expansive area. Moreover, conditions can vary wildly even within the region enclosed by a single warning.The National Weather Service is hoping to change that.Kodi Berry leads the program that’s updating warnings at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla. The Forecasting a Continuum of Environmental Threats program, or FACETs, is an endeavor the National Weather Service is pursuing to communicate the hazards posed by severe thunderstorms on a hyperlocal level.Berry says the goal is provide a more continuous flow of information for those who need it the most.More precise warningsAccording to the National Severe Storms Laboratory, FACETs aims to improve weather watches and warnings to provide “detailed hazard information through the use of ‘threat grids’ that are monitored and adjusted as new information becomes available.”Typical weather warnings are issued in the form of polygons digitally drawn on a map. If you’re within the polygon, you’re alerted and urged to take action — such as seeking shelter. But just a stone’s throw away, a neighboring home outside the polygon may not be given any special instructions. The state of weather warnings is binary, akin to a “yes” or “no” to severe weather.Berry’s team is hoping to improve that by creating a product that reflects the gray area in between. They are experimenting with displaying probabilities to reflect the range of possible outcomes in a rapidly evolving severe weather event.“There has been a lot of social science research that shows that, given probabilistic information, people make better decisions,” Berry said. “If we appropriately define these probabilities and what they mean, people can use them to make better decisions.”Imagine you work in a nursing home 20 miles downwind of a tornado-producing thunderstorm. An existing tornado warning extends only 15 miles downstream, so you’re not under a warning — yet.But you know it takes half an hour or more to move all the residents to shelter. Do you start now? Or do you wait until a warning is (or is not) issued?Berry’s team found the one-size-fits-all binary nature of warnings doesn’t necessarily fit all consumers. “Some people may need a little more time than what the warning provides,” Berry said. “They may have a lower personal probability threshold.”A probabilistic approachAdding probabilities will not replace existing weather warnings but rather offer more context for people around the warning itself. The probabilities will be assigned on a gridded map, much like most weather forecasts, and will update by the minute in real time.Probabilities will be greatest along the center of the storm’s predicted path, diminishing radially outward as well as farther downwind. Berry’s office compares the so-called plume to the probabilistic wind speed graphics issued by the National Hurricane Center.Severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings themselves are getting an overhaul, too. Warnings will now “move” with storms, growing downwind if a storm looks to hold together. The back edge of the warning will “drop out” behind the storm, too — akin to an “all clear” message once the danger has passed.“I think the most beneficial thing is the more equitable lead time,” Berry said. “[In the past], people near the downstream edge of the warning [got] much less lead time if they [weren’t] weather aware.”The warnings themselves will also be updated more frequently. “I think the National Weather Service policy [currently] is that a tornado warning should be updated … once every 15 minutes,” explained Berry. “We’ve tested one-minute updates, two-minute updates. … We started to notice a big difference when we got to the five or two minute [intervals].”Streamlining the processAll this updating could dramatically heighten a forecaster’s workload, particularly in environments with multiple storms occurring simultaneously. That’s where automation comes in.“[Meteorologists] are getting some automated guidance that isn’t solely radar,” Berry said. While details are hazy as to what this computer software guidance might look like, it would likely ingest data from surface observations, satellite products, lightning mapping arrays and more.That means some severe weather warning updates could theoretically be entirely computer-generated. But that doesn’t mean anything is being left on autopilot.“There’s a lot of forecaster value that I don’t think can be replaced by automation,” Berry said. “One of the features that we included [in an online interface] was to be able to graphically tell which ones were automated versus which ones had been touched by the forecaster."The shape of the warning could also be changed by automated software packages based on severe weather probabilities churned out by high-resolution computer models. Berry’s team is working on a proposal regarding best practices to prevent fluctuations in the forecast to result in an “expanding and contracting [warning] with time.”“You don’t want people going in or out of the warning,” Berry said. “We’re working to create more consistency with the warning.”Berry estimates these changes could take up to five years to implement. By then, atmospheric scientists are hoping to overhaul their strategy for issuing weather warnings — making calls based on forecasts, rather than detection.Warn on forecastIn the current system, a severe thunderstorm warning isn’t issued until a storm meets severe thunderstorm criteria — the capability of producing damaging wind or hail larger than the size of quarters. The same is true with tornado warnings — rotation must be spotted within a storm.With more advanced high-resolution computer models, NOAA aims to model individual thunderstorms before they become severe or generate a tornado, issuing warnings based on the forecast of severe weather. Such modeling would test the limits of current forecasting, since they would have to detect weather features at local scales many current models miss.There may even come a day when you’ll get a severe thunderstorm or tornado warning while standing beneath a blue sky — awaiting a storm that has yet to develop. 
World leaders, with the notable exception of Donald Trump, stumped up nearly €7.4bn (£6.5bn) to research Covid-19 vaccines and therapies at a virtual event convened by the EU, pledging the money will also be used to distribute any vaccine to poor countries on time and equitably.But in a sign of the fractured state of global health diplomacy, the event was not addressed by India, Russia or the US. After a weekend of persuasion, China was represented by its ambassador to the EU.A separate Covid-19 summit was staged earlier in the day and addressed by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and other world leaders including the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani.The EU-convened virtual summit was addressed in person by the leaders of France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Japan, Jordan, Norway, Israel, South Africa and the EU, and took the form of a pledging marathon.But the US state department released a statement welcoming what it described as “the pledging conference in Europe”, even though the fundraising summit had always been envisaged as a global, rather than strictly European effort.The US also highlighted its “vaccine partnership to prioritise drug candidates and streamline clinical trials”. Trump has suggested a vaccine will be ready by the end of the year but many scientists are sceptical that even with global cooperation such a timetable can be met.The money is largely designed to speed up the process by raising guaranteed funds to coordinate research and incentivise pharmaceutical companies to distribute any vaccines and therapies to poorer countries, something that did not happen in the 2009 swine flu outbreak.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said any distributed vaccine “won’t belong to anybody”.“Those who invent it of course will be fairly paid, but access will be given to people across the globe by the organisation we chose,” he said.EU officials said pharmaceutical companies who will receive the funding will not be requested to forgo their intellectual property rights on the new vaccine and treatments, but they should commit to make them available worldwide at affordable prices. A similar process has occurred through Gavi, the global vaccine fund, which gives a global alliance leverage over the distribution and price of a vaccine.Boris Johnson was introduced to the summit by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, as “a man who has been though every possible emotion in the past month”. The UK prime minister insisted the search for a vaccine was not a competition between countries, but instead required cooperation that “defies the usual ways of operating”.He said: “We’ll need a truly global effort – because no one country, and no one pharmaceutical company, will be able to do this alone. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It’s humanity against the virus.”Many leaders used their brief speeches to assert their support for the existing multilateral architecture for global health, including the World Health Organization. The US last month suspended funding for the WHO, criticising its relationship with China.Erna Solberg, the Norwegian prime minister and summit co-host, said “we support the leadership of the World Health Organization”, adding that without the UN body “an effective and coordinated response to the pandemic would not be possible”.She said that “multilateral cooperation is more important than ever” and the meeting was the start of a global movement “never seen before”.At the parallel “non-aligned movement” summit, Rouhani attacked the US decision to pull out of the WHO, describing it as “a strategic blunder”.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom, in his address to the EU-convened event , pointed out how quickly the genetic sequence of the virus had been shared by China amongst scientists globally.The EU said near the close of the summit that a total of 7.36bn of the €7.5bn sought had been pledged, with the largest national pledges coming from Japan and Norway. France, Italy and Germany all pledged around €500m each. Turkey’s contribution will be announced later in the month.The precise value of individual countries pledges announced during the two-hour event was hard to calculate since some leaders drew on previous pledges, or earmarked their national contribution for specific bodies like the Red Cross, the WHO or Gavi. Von der Leyen said the summit had revealed “fantastic momentum” and that it was possible to turn the tide against the virus.From the €7.5bn initially sought, €4bn is for the development of a vaccine, €2bn for treatments and €1.5bn for the manufacture of tests, according to the European commission.The precise methodology of the new fund, including how to select a vaccine for funding and the strings to be attached, was not made clear during the many rhetorical speeches. But the world leaders want to work with existing global health bodies such as Gavi as much as possible.The driving idea behind the summit, pushed by the Gates Foundation, is that an alliance is needed not just to coordinate research for a vaccine, but also for therapies and testing.Jeremy Farrar, the Wellcome Trust director, said: “I would have loved China and the US to be part of the fundraising summit … both countries had incredibly deep medical knowledge innovation and expertise and a strong manufacturing base.”He added: “My guess is that those countries that have not yet signed up will sign up in the course of May to make sure this is a truly global event. We need everyone.”David Salisbury from the thinktank Chatham House noted, however: “We have to admit there is a tension between countries that want to protect their populations and the desire to spread the vaccine equitably. It will not be a vote winner to offer a share in available vaccine to less-privileged countries.“The factories for the biggest vaccine manufacturers are in Europe, the US and India. Will European manufacturers be obliged by the EU to restrict sales first to European countries?” 
As Anthony Davis fielded questions about what his return to New Orleans on Wednesday might feel like, he stared across the Los Angeles Lakers' locker room at someone who already has answers about how to navigate an uneasy homecoming: LeBron James.Of course James remembers the animosity in the air when he played his first game in Cleveland with the Miami Heat. He remembers it so well that he knows the date -- Dec. 2, 2010 -- as if it were a loved one's birthday.Nearly a decade later, James is trying to prepare Davis for what to expect when New Orleans Pelicans fans will surely pelt him with vitriol pent up from seeing their franchise player walk out the door. In the past week, a number of Lakers spoke about the issue."I talked to him," James said, "because I know what it's like going into a situation where you would call home for seven years. ... He's a kid when he got there, and he became a man along that seven-year journey, so it's just going to be a different situation for him personally."Davis said he has already had a dress rehearsal. "[I] felt like I was on the other side," he said, when he was booed at home in February in his first game after the trade deadline when he was still with the Pelicans despite requesting a trade. This time, he will actually be on the other side when he is introduced as a Laker."I got a little taste of it, but I know it's going to be even worse," Davis said last week.A couple of days later, as the game drew closer, he was more blunt about what he expected."I'm pretty sure every time I catch the ball, it's probably going to be boos and stuff like that," Davis said. "Obviously they're fans of the Pelicans. And I understand why they feel that way, but it's all love on my end."Lining up for the Pelicans, if healthy, will be former Lakers Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart -- only adding juice to the matchup."It's going to be a great battle," Davis said. "Those guys are going to try to take our heads off just to prove a point and -- I don't want to say I want to take their heads off, [but] I just want to win it."James might have played the most notable "reunion game" out of all the Lakers, but he is not the only one of Davis' teammates to experience it firsthand.Rajon Rondo played in Boston less than a month after being traded to Dallas. Danny Green went back to play in San Antonio after the Spurs traded him to Toronto following eight fruitful years. Dwight Howard visited Orlando his first time around as a Laker. Even Lakers coach Frank Vogel knows the feeling, having coached the Magic in Indiana after spending nine years with the Pacers.Some of those return games were dynamite. Some were duds. All of them are stories Davis can learn from."Just focus on getting the win," Rondo told ESPN. "That's all that matters. You want to go back and beat your home team -- or your old team. Just focus on getting the W. And you go from there. Let your game speak for itself. Don't try to press anything. Just be who you are. He doesn't have to go out there and try to score 50 -- even though he can do it, probably, any night. Just go out there and get the win."Of course, that's easy for Rondo to say. Not only did the Mavericks beat the Celtics by 18 when he graced the parquet again, the point guard put up a season-high 29 points on 12-for-19 shooting."S---, if he wants to have a big game, of course he wants to have a game," Rondo said. "I just want to get a W. Anybody who is playing against their old team, I want to beat their ass and go from there."James' performance was even more impressive -- 38 points and eight assists in 30 minutes in a 28-point win -- and Davis knows about it."Bron told me he had like, I want to say 39 [points] in his return, so put a little pressure on me," Davis said. "Like I said, if we get the win, that's more than enough."Howard also got the win in Orlando, and his 39 points were the most he has ever scored as a Laker.Others weren't so fortunate. The Pacers drilled Vogel's Magic squad by 19."It wasn't fun," Vogel said. "It's no fun losing to your prior team, especially for me where I had deep roots there in Indiana."And Green had one of the worst games of his career, going 0-for-7 from the field with three fouls in an 18-point loss."Before the game, you do so much more of saying hello and showing love to the coaching staff, arena people," Green said. "You don't really have a chance to work out and lock in on the game. It's tough. It's weird, nostalgic."Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, asked to reflect on Green's return, said: "We honored the hell out of him, [me] personally and collectively as an organization."Green said the show of appreciation stirred up emotions, causing him to think about his entire career. But it wasn't just that. The experience of coming back to his house, which he had abandoned for months as he rented a furnished home in Toronto, was another unanticipated wrinkle."It didn't feel like home," Green told ESPN. "I hadn't been there in a while. ... You go on the road, there's a time when you always come back home. But it felt like I had been on the road for a really long time. I hadn't been to my house in a long time, so it was strange."Green ended up winning the championship in his lone season in Toronto -- as the saying goes, the best way to get over a breakup is to live your best life. And Davis is returning from a position of strength -- the Lakers are No. 1 in the West, while the Pelicans are No. 11."I'm excited to play it. I just don't want to get through it, I'm excited to play," Davis said. "It's going to be fun."And if there are moments that are not so fun, he is equipped for them too."I have help there," Davis said. "I have someone to lean on who's been through it and just letting me know like, 'Look, [do] X, Y and Z, just do this,' whatever, whatever and help me throughout that entire game."The hope is that with all the guidance available to him, the night can shrink in significance from something he perceives as an epic event to just another game."The greatest thing is when you finally get on the floor and that ball tips up," James said. "There's nothing but strictly basketball, and everything else doesn't matter at that point."
iPhone and iPad users will now be able to lock Google Drive. This way, you will not have to sign out of Google’s cloud storage service when handing over your device to someone else. The Privacy Screen feature, which is now available on iOS and iPadOS, would require Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode to approve access to Google Drive. The authentication process will take place every time the Google Drive app is opened. However, since it would be a little annoying to authenticate yourself every time you go to Drive, you can set a timer to choose how long it should be before the app is locked. The activation of the lock screen can be delayed for 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes. And, of course, you can choose to keep the feature off if you want. As good as the Privacy Screen feature sounds, it does have some limitations. For instance, you cannot lock specific files or folders, and notifications will still pop up. It also doesn’t apply to certain Siri functionalities.It also doesn't cover the Photos app and the Files app. If you do not have this feature already, you can go to the App Store and update the Google Drive app.
The House of Representatives on Thursday passed Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s drug pricing legislation, a sweeping bill that will allow the U.S. government to negotiate lower prices on the costliest drugs each year.The legislation, which passed the House 230 to 192, was widely expected to be approved in the House, where Democrats control the chamber with 233 seats versus 197 held by Republicans. Pelosi reached an agreement days before with a key bloc of liberal Democrats who thought the bill didn’t go far enough and were threatening to oppose it on the House floor. Two Republicans voted in support of the bill.The bill’s chances of becoming law are slim. The legislation is unlikely to be taken up in the Senate, where lawmakers have introduced a competing health-care bill. Additionally, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has previously ruled out any action on Pelosi’s bill, and President Donald Trump, who is in the middle of an impeachment inquiry, has vowed to veto it. Nevertheless, the legislation will likely give voters a preview of the party’s platform on health care ahead of the 2020 elections.The legislation “delivers on President Trump’s promise to the American people,” Pelosi said Thursday, referring to Trump’s comments in 2016 that he would “negotiate” the cost of drugs “like crazy.” “Negotiation is what this bill is about.”Current rules prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare — the federal government’s health insurance plan for the elderly. Private insurers use pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate drug rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers in exchange for better coverage.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates Pelosi’s bill, if enacted, would save Medicare $456 billion over a decade but also keep eight new drugs from coming to the U.S. market.Republicans and the drug industry were heavily opposed to the bill. House Republicans criticized it as highly partisan and warned that the legislation would spur the loss of lifesaving cures and medical innovation. Industry trade group PhRMA, or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, shared similar sentiments, saying it would result in at least 56 fewer medicines.Private equity investors had also been lobbying against Pelosi’s bill, telling her legislative aides in a series of private meetings in recent weeks that the plan would dry up financing for small biotech companies.“With today’s vote, the House prioritized politics at the expense of innovation, American jobs and hope for patients,” PhRMA president and CEO Stephen Ubl said in a statement Thursday.Pelosi and fellow House Democratic leaders had been working for months on a plan to reduce U.S. drug prices. High prescription drug costs have become a rare bipartisan issue, drawing support from Democrats in Congress and the Trump administration. Health care remains a top issue for voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Congress and the Trump administration are trying to pass legislation before the end of the year that would bring more transparency to health-care costs and, ultimately, lower costs for consumers.In the Senate, lawmakers are working on their own drug pricing bill, seen as a more “moderate” alternative to Pelosi’s.Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking Democrat Ron Wyden, of Oregon, unveiled last week a revamped version of their bipartisan drug price bill that is backed by Trump. It would make changes to Medicare by adding an out-of-pocket maximum for beneficiaries and capping drug price increases at the rate of inflation, among other measures. 
Job creation posted a solid rebound in March, with nonfarm payrolls expanding by 196,000 and the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.8%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.That was better than the 175,000 Dow Jones estimate and comes after a dismal February that had economists wondering whether the decade-old economic expansion was nearing an end. The unemployment rate met expectations.“With a strong March employment report now in the books, we’ve gotten some reassurance that the labor market is still strong,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group. “Of course, last month’s nosedive was disappointing, especially after December and January had such impressive numbers despite some sizable headwinds. But a good March report shows that February was more of an outlier than a canary in the coal mine.”Wage gains fell off the recent strong pace, increasing just 0.14% for the month and 3.2% year over year, below expectations of the 3.4% pace from last month. The average work week increased by 0.1 hour to 34.5 hours.A broader gauge of unemployment that also counts discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons also was unchanged at 7.3%. The measure, known as the “real unemployment rate” is down from 7.9% a year ago.Job gains were fairly broad based.Health care led with 49,000 new workers, professional and technical services added 34,000 and food and drinking establishments contributed 27,000. Construction rose by 16,000 but manufacturing saw 6,000 jobs lost.The numbers came a month after February’s jaw-dropping gain of just 20,000, which was revised up to 33,000 in the March report. January’s big increase of 311,000 also got pushed up a nudge to 312,000, bringing the average gain over the past three months to 180,000. That’s still solid though below the 233,000 average monthly gain for all of 2018.Household survey data showed there were 201,000 fewer people counted as employed, but that came with a contraction of the labor force by 224,000. Those counted as not in the labor force increased by 369,000 to 95.6 million.The labor force participation rate declined to 63%, down 0.2 percentage points to its lowest level since November.The total employment level nudged down to 156.7 million, while those counted as unemployed also edged lower to just over 6.2 million.Broadly speaking, the report is likely to restore some confidence in a labor market that had looked shaky and an economy whose prospects were equally uncertain. Wednesday’s private payrolls reading from ADP and Moody’s Analytics was well below market expectations, indicating that more bad news could be on the horizon. Early-year data on retail sales and housing looked bad from a consumer standpoint, though some of those numbers have improved lately.Economic conditions now look more favorable than they did at the start of the year. First-quarter GDP is projected to rise 2.1%, according to the Atlanta Fed, which had been tracking gains of just 0.2% only a few weeks ago. Fourth-quarter GDP increased by 2.2%, bringing the 2018 calendar year increase to 2.9%.Federal Reserve officials continue to watch the jobs numbers closely as well. The central bank recently has indicated that it is on extended pause for more rate hikes as it evaluates the data coming through.Market pricing currently sees about 50-50 chance the Fed cuts its benchmark interest rate before the end of the year. But that, too, has been in flux. By the Chicago Fed’s measure, financial conditions are at the easiest in 25 years, indicating little need for the central bank to provide more accommodation.“The 196,000 jobs added in March shows the US economy is not stalling out, something investors were worried about following February’s disappointing numbers. And other data in the report showed wages are rising but not at a rate which would spur inflation,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. “This was a perfect report for equity investors as it shows the US economy is still marching along while the wage numbers will keep the FOMC on the sidelines.”
The stock market has been hitting record high levels day after day, but that doesn’t mean corporate CEOs are bullish about next year, according to J.P. Morgan Chase regional investment banking head John Richert.Instead, CEOs are worried about delivering earnings growth amid increasingly uncertain times, thanks to slowing growth around the world, the U.S.-China trade dispute and upcoming U.S. presidential election. As a result, most of the CEOs Richert speaks with are reining in capital spending for 2020 and modeling how a possible recession will impact their business, he said.“Everybody looks at the stock market and sees share prices going through the roof right now, but few of the CEOs I talk to feel good about that,” Richert said. “There is an increased worry about their ability to deliver results amid prolonged periods of uncertainty next year.”The uncertainty for corporate leaders about 2020 and beyond has created an unusual situation: While CEO confidence is at the lowest in a decade, consumers are relatively optimistic, buoyed by wage gains and unemployment levels near 50-year lows, according to the non-profit Conference Board. Consumer spending has helped keep the U.S. economy out of recession, despite the impact of tariffs, but its unclear how long that will last.Regardless of how that tension resolves, CEO anxiety over the future has translated into a record level of engagements with corporate clients, said Richert, who focuses on companies that generate $500 million to $5 billion in annual revenue.The pipeline for potential deals in his group is the highest it’s ever been, Richert said, and his bankers are increasingly being called to examine companies’ capital plans and offer strategic possibilities like divesting non-core businesses.“There’s a lot of discussions among industry players to figure out the best way to put companies together,” he said. For the mid-cap companies under his purview, Richert said that CEOs are increasingly examining so-called “mergers of equals” to scale up and help firms weather a future downturn.Warren catalyst?In particular, the upcoming election offers a wide range of outcomes: Another four years of what is generally seen as a pro-business environment under Trump, or the possibility of sweeping, structural changes to regulation and taxes if a Democrat such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren were to win.If Warren or a similar figure gains momentum, that could jolt CEOs into acting on deal-making plans on the possibility that valuations would decline, Richert said. The record stock market has some business owners on the deal sidelines as they hold out for ever-higher prices, he added.The corporate anxiety hasn’t been evenly distributed, Richert said: Manufacturers, transportation and consumer retail companies are facing harder times than technology and service firms.“You talk to any industrial, old-line economy company here in the U.S., they’ll tell you we’re in a recession right now,” he said. “The service economy and tech is keeping the cycle going for now.”Richert’s group, a once-sleepy area of investment banking targeting smaller companies, has gained in prominence as competitors including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have ramped up hiring. His unit garnered record revenue in the third quarter, up roughly 25% from a year earlier, and J.P. Morgan plans to hire another 10 senior bankers early next year, Richert said.
Tesla's general counsel, Jonathan Chang, has left the company, Bloomberg's Dana Hull first reported. The artificial-intelligence startup SambaNova Systems announced in a press release on Thursday that Chang has become the company's general counsel.Chang's departure marks the third time Tesla's top lawyer has left the electric-car maker in the past year. Dane Butswinkas, Chang's predecessor, left the company in February after just two months in the role. Butswinkas followed Todd Maron, who held the position from 2014 until the end of 2018.Chang's final day was December 6, according to Bloomberg's report. He joined Tesla in 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile.Tesla and Chang did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment. Bloomberg reported that Tesla did not respond to its questions about Chang's departure and his replacement.Chang's tenure as Tesla's general counsel overlapped with two high-profile legal issues: an allegation from the Securities and Exchange Commission that Tesla CEO Elon Musk had violated their 2018 settlement by tweeting a projection about the company's 2019 production numbers, and a lawsuit from Walmart alleging that Tesla failed to address issues with solar panels that caught fire. Both disputes ended in settlements.Tesla is known for its high rate of executive turnover, which has exceeded that of other high-profile tech companies, according to an August research note from AllianceBernstein. This year has also seen the departure of CTO JB Straubel, CFO Deepak Ahuja, and vice president of production Peter Hocholdinger.
For the first time in 39 seasons on "Survivor," a contestant has been ejected.On Wednesday's episode of "Survivor: Island of the Idols," Dan Spilo was pulled from the competition by production for unacceptable behavior following an off-camera incident. "A decision has been made, and Dan will not be returning to the game," host Jeff Probst announced to the remaining castaways. "He won't be coming back to camp, he won't be on the jury. He's gone."At the end of the episode, a title card read: "Dan was removed from the game after a report of another incident, which happened off-camera and did not involve a player."The exact reason for Spilo's removal was not disclosed. 'Survivor': Jeff Probst, Kellee Kim address Dan Spilo's 'extremely inappropriate' behaviorSpilo has stirred controversy on this season of the CBS reality show since day one, when fellow castaway Kellee Kim complained about his "inappropriate touching."Kim's concerns boiled over on day 22 when Spilo's behavior continued and producers intervened after Kim became emotional during an interview. In an onscreen message, viewers learned that "producers met with all the players, both as a group and individually. They were cautioned about personal boundaries and reminded that producers are available to them at all times. Based on the outcome of those discussions, the game continued. In addition, producers met privately with Dan, at which time he was issued a warning for his behavior," the text continued. "Producers continue to monitor the situation." Spilo, 48, a talent manager from Los Angeles, was ultimately ejected on day 36. In a statement posted to Twitter, Kim shared her thoughts on the ousting. "While Dan’s dismissal has validated the concerns that I raised from the beginning of this season, I wish that no one else had to be subjected to this type of behavior," the statement read. "CBS and 'Survivor' were on notice of Dan’s behavior from the very first days of the game. And, as 'Survivor' fans know, shortly after I spoke up on camera, I was voted off the show."She continued, "Since then, I’ve accepted genuine, heartfelt apologies from fellow castaways, but I’ve continued to feel disappointed by how this pattern of behavior was allowed to occur for so long. While I wish many things had gone differently, I’m glad that my decision to speak up made a difference."USA TODAY has reached out to CBS for comment.After the episode aired, Probst, who also serves as the executive producer, told Entertainment Tonight that Spilo "was not happy" about being removed from the game. "We talked through everything for quite a while, and by the time he got on the boat to leave, he had calmed down and was actually very respectful as he departed," he added.Probst called this season "unprecedented.""Complex social issues were woven into the game in a way we have never seen before," he said. "With our contestants’ welfare at the forefront, we have spent a lot of time discussing every layer of the situation with human resources, diversity and inclusion representatives, show therapists, lawyers, publicists, and standards and practices. We all worked diligently throughout the entire process to make the right decisions and portray an accurate depiction of what took place. We have learned a lot, and it will inform our process moving forward."He continued: "While we still want to maintain the competitive aspect of the game, above all, we want to ensure that all players always feel safe and respected."
President Donald Trump's demands for the next coronavirus aid package are running into a stubborn obstacle: his own party.Asked what he thought of a payroll tax cut, the subject of Trump's ultimatum for any new bill, Sen. Chuck Grassley didn't hesitate."Right now, not much," the Senate Finance Committee chairman said, worrying that the tax cut could drain retirement funds or leave older Americans with the view that Congress doesn’t take “seriously” the plight of the Social Security Trust Fund.“I’m going to give it due consideration, if I can see a strong group of people who think it’s the right thing to do,” added Grassley (R-Iowa), whose committee handles federal tax policy. But he said the president’s preference wouldn’t be the last word — a sentiment shared by many in the Senate GOP: “The president proposes, we dispose.”As Washington begins zeroing in on its next major coronavirus bill, congressional Republicans are on a different trajectory than the president and are themselves divided on the payroll tax cut, or whether to do anything at all. Much of the party has coalesced behind providing liability protections that Democrats disdain, yet Trump is eyeing the much flashier tax cut as the centerpiece of the upcoming legislation. Meanwhile, House Democrats are moving ahead with their own big relief bill that Republicans are certain to reject.A divided GOP combined with a partisan House Democratic plan and a president with his own goals is a formula for deeply complicated negotiations and an uncertain outlook, even as millions are losing their jobs and the Paycheck Protection Program threatens to run out of money for the second time since its inception.Republicans are taking it slow on the next round of talks, but they’ve already made a clear ask of their Democratic counterparts: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has spent the past week touting his insistence that new legislation relax liabilities for businesses and employees that get back to work amid the pandemic.It seems highly unlikely Republicans can draw red lines on both McConnell’s liability protections and the president’s payroll tax cut in exchange for reaching an agreement with Democrats to provide billions more to ailing state and local governments.“They’ve got to get their act together,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).While there’s plenty of GOP support for the liability provisions, the president’s beloved tax cut is another story. Republicans are not universally in favor of it. And McConnell hates dividing his conference because it weakens his negotiating hand.When asked about Trump's demand on payroll taxes on Tuesday, McConnell said "if there's any red line, it's on litigation." And in interviews with a series of Republicans on Tuesday it was clear why McConnell was focusing on the liability angle rather than the payroll tax cut.Sen. John Thune of South Dakota (R-S.D.), McConnell’s top deputy, said that protecting employers and employees from lawsuits is “straightforward.” But when asked about the payroll tax cut, he replied: “I’m not a particular fan of that.”“I guess I’m open to being persuaded that it’s something that could be effective. But I think some of the things we’re currently doing are having a bigger impact,” he said, listing aid programs for small businesses and direct payments to the public. “The payroll tax cut only helps if you’re on the payroll.”Congress in March deferred employers' payroll taxes for the year. But Trump has been explicit that more needs to be done for workers.“We’re not doing anything without a payroll tax cut,” Trump told Fox News over the weekend. On Tuesday, he re-upped that demand, adding in that he wants to eliminate sanctuary cities for undocumented immigrants and “perhaps” cutting capital gains taxes as well.A White House official said the president is “passionate” about the idea of a payroll tax cut as one that gives workers more buying power and helps businesses more easily staff up moving forward. After failing to secure it in previous aid bills, Trump may be even more determined this time around.“It should be on the table. The president supports it. You shore up the trust fund with a transfer,” agreed Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). "This is a way to get more dollars into the hands of employees as well as employers.”Democrats are averse to both the payroll tax cut and the liability reform. Asked about Trump’s declaration on the payroll tax during a Monday appearance on CNN, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said “no way” and that drawing a line in the sand was counterproductive. But she also said she wasn't going to negotiate in the press.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said on Tuesday that it would be a “serious mistake” to embrace shielding companies from coronavirus lawsuits and that he would not rule out the payroll tax. But he also made clear that Democrats are “of the impression that Nancy Pelosi has the lead on the negotiation.”Some Republicans said the war of words between Pelosi and Trump was all part of the dance.“I heard the speaker say ‘no way’ and the president said he wouldn't sign a bill without it. So it sounds like the beginning of a negotiation,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). Still, he added that while there would be debate about the payroll tax cut, liability reform was an “imperative.”Yet having two starkly different messages from the White House and Republicans in Congress often undercuts the GOP’s negotiating stance. And if Trump wants to win over his party he's got work to do, even among strong allies.Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who is close to the president, said he agreed with McConnell's focus on liability protections and that while he liked the idea of cutting taxes, it weighed on him to draw down the Social Security accounts. Maybe, he said, the best thing for Congress to do is nothing at all.“I’m not really for more stuff here. I’m here to oppose anything more coming from Washington,” Paul said. “Because there’s nothing to give.”
Has Justin Bieber been influenced by those peace-offering cookies that ended the Katy Perry/Taylor Swift beef?On Wednesday, Bieber told TMZ that he "was just messing around" when he proposed a "fight in the octagon" with Tom Cruise via social media Sunday. The "Love Yourself" singer's tweet could easily have been interpreted as aggressive."I wanna challenge Tom Cruise to fight in the octagon," Bieber, 25, wrote, without explaining why. "Tom if you dont (sic) take this fight your (sic) scared and you will never live it down. Who is willing to put on the fight?"More: Justin Bieber draws heat for defending Chris Brown, calling past assault charge a ‘mistake’"The story is, I (saw) an interview with him, and it was just on my mind," the singer explained in the TMZ video, adding that he doesn't know Cruise personally. "I don't know why I thought about... It was just a random tweet. I do that stuff sometimes."To his credit, Bieber was realistic about his own chances. He predicted that the "Mission: Impossible" actor, who still does much of his own stunt work even into his 50s, would "probably whoop my (expletive) in a fight" and that if the two were to throw down, he'd have to work on getting in "good shape."More: Justin Bieber has a top-secret project coming to YouTube, now focusing on homegrown starsFurthermore, Bieber, who described himself as "really skinny," guessed that Cruise would "probably be out of my weight class" and remarked the star has "that dad strength." Before departing, the artist made sure to clear up any animosity."Love you Tom," he said, while holding up the peace sign. 
ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands — More than two years after back-to-back hurricanes ravaged this tropical island, medical workers are still treating gunshot wounds in hallways and kidney failure in a trailer. They ignore their own inflamed rashes that they say are caused by the mold that has shut down an entire hospital floor below a still-porous roof.At least they have a hospital. The lone medical center on Vieques, an idyllic island that is part of Puerto Rico, was severely damaged by Hurricanes Maria and Irma, then abandoned to wandering roosters and grazing horses. Ailing people wait at the ferry dock to catch a boat to the mainland.Two years on, “we are in the same situation as we were in the days after the hurricane,” said Rafael Surillo Ruiz, the mayor of Yabucoa, on Puerto Rico’s hard-hit eastern edge.An examination of Federal Emergency Management Agency data and records demonstrates the degree to which the recovery from Hurricanes Maria and Irma on America’s Caribbean islands has been stalled compared with some of the most disaster-prone states on the mainland, leaving the islands’ critical infrastructure in squalor and limbo. FEMA officials say 190 long-term recovery projects have been funded in Puerto Rico — out of more than 9,000 requests. On the United States Virgin Islands, about 218 projects had funding — out of more than 1,500 requests and still counting.In contrast, about 3,700 large and small permanent work projects had obligated funding in Texas, two years after Hurricane Harvey hit the Gulf Coast in August 2017. More than 3,700 such projects had been funded over that time in Florida. That disparity underscored how a federal government in Washington has treated citizens on the mainland, with voting representatives in Congress and a say in presidential contests, compared with citizens on the islands. Further complicating the recovery are issues of corruption, often amplified by President Trump and, islanders say, questions of race.“At the end of the day, we’re talking about the life and the well-being of human beings,” said Dyma Williams, the acting chief executive at the Gov. Juan F. Luis Hospital on St. Croix. “I hate to make the distinction about American versus not American, but at the end of the day, we’re not being treated the same way as other Americans are being treated.”Jeffrey Byard, the associate administrator for the Office of Response and Recovery at FEMA, said the agency had never seen recovery efforts like those from the natural disasters of 2017, which included Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma, as well as wildfires in California.“Comparing disasters misleads the American people,” he said. “Each event has a unique set of circumstances, and numbers alone cannot and do not provide a complete picture of what is needed to help communities recover.”FEMA, through its public assistance program, helps communities recover from major disasters by assisting with debris removal, lifesaving emergency protective measures and public infrastructure reconstruction. Debris removal and protective measures are classified as emergency work. The “permanent work” of public infrastructure repair is what guarantees long-term recovery.And that permanent work is in little evidence on St. Croix and in Puerto Rico.“When you’re living on an island and you don’t have a voice on decisions that are made, that tends to happen to you,” said Yves Abraham, the principal of St. Croix’s hard-hit Central High School. “Who do you gripe to? All we can do is sit and wait.”FEMA officials say much of the problem lies with the system that Washington uses to pay for recovery assistance. Local governments or charities usually front the money to at least begin construction and then are reimbursed by FEMA. But the islands have seen a sluggish economic recovery after the hurricanes.“Because of the fiscal challenges and their situation financially, they don’t have the funding or access to loans,” said Chris Currie, the director of the Government Accountability Office team that studies disaster relief. “So they are completely reliant on FEMA.”Hopes were raised recently at the Juan F. Luis Hospital with the appearance of a row of trailers where the community could be treated until a replacement hospital is built. But Adrienne Williams-Octalien, the director of the local disaster recovery office on St. Croix, said the island did not have the upfront funds to start retrofitting the trailers, and help from FEMA had been delayed by a tussle over how much of the costs the federal agency would cover. That has pushed the completion date of even the temporary structure to the spring of 2020 — near the start of the next hurricane season.“Most municipalities and agencies, which is what we are focusing on right now, don’t have the money to start the work,” said Ottmar J. Chavez, the executive director of Puerto Rico’s Central Office for Recovery, Reconstruction and Resiliency.Almost from the beginning, relief funds have been caught in Trump-era politics, with freighted charges coming from Democrats and the White House.“From Day 1, right after Maria hit Puerto Rico, there has been a different standard for how the administration responded to Harvey and Irma,” said Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, Democrat of New York and the first Puerto Rican woman elected to the House. She grew emotional as she described her trip to Vieques this month; her own sister had no power for 13 months.The mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz, who personally clashed with the president, said she had searched for the answer for why the recovery effort in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had been so slow and could come up with only one: Those places were treated with no sense of urgency because the victims were people of color.“You can kill people with a gun or you can kill them with neglect,” Ms. Cruz said.Some officials on the islands conceded that they bore some responsibility; they have struggled to retain local staff and have had difficulty with the paperwork needed to assess hurricane damage.Mr. Byard referred to what he called Puerto Rico’s “history of fiscal mismanagement of U.S. taxpayer dollars.”Mr. Trump has complained often about waste and fraud, especially in Puerto Rico, where the governor, Ricardo A. Rosselló, resigned in July amid a popular uprising driven by decades of mismanagement.In truth, misuse of FEMA disaster relief is as old as the agency itself. After Hurricane Katrina, a Texas hotel owner was charged with submitting $232,000 in bills for phantom victims. Officials ordered mobile homes worth nearly half a billion dollars that were never used, and renovations for a shelter at a former Alabama Army base cost $416,000 per evacuee.In their criticism of Puerto Rico, White House aides pointed to 375 public corruption convictions between 2008 and 2017, but that figure was driven largely by a federal investigation into its police force in 2011. During the same time frame, Texas had almost 1,000 public corruption convictions.James Lee Witt, who led FEMA from 1993 through 2001, noted that in September 1995, Hurricane Marilyn struck St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, damaged or destroyed most of the homes, closed the island’s hospital and cut off most communication. FEMA completed what he considered a smooth and fast recovery.Now, he said, he knows of contractors in the Caribbean who are not being paid and have suspended operations until they are. Others have yet to start.Congress recognized the slow pace of recovery in Puerto Rico and on the Virgin Islands when it allowed FEMA to waive certain requirements for reconstruction of infrastructure on the islands, including the rebuilding of hospitals and schools. The federal agency no longer needed to consider the condition of the facilities before the disasters in order to rebuild them.FEMA made another significant concession for Puerto Rico. For some projects in the past, the agency has used “alternative procedures” that allowed a local government and FEMA to negotiate the overall cost of a rebuilding effort; FEMA would then front the money in a flat-fee contract rather than reimburse the local government later. As Puerto Rico’s recovery stalled, FEMA decided to use that method to finance virtually all of the infrastructure rebuilding projects.But those concessions have not cut through the distrust. Puerto Rico says FEMA is lowballing its rebuilding estimates, while FEMA accuses Puerto Rico of exaggerating costs. Because they cannot agree on project-by-project recovery costs, work cannot beginSo far, FEMA and other agencies have disbursed about $14 billion in aid to Puerto Rico, out of an estimated $91 billion that will be needed over the next two decades, Mr. Chavez said. Most of that money went toward debris removal, emergency home repairs and restoring power, which took almost a year.Teachers at the Hope School, a special-needs public school in San Juan, were able to raise $60,000 for air-conditioners for the stricken building. They are still waiting for FEMA to reimburse them, the head of the school said. The Berwind Intermediate School in San Juan has been abandoned because of mold and water damage, its students shipped to an overcrowded school nearby.“We have been able to deal with it, but it is uncomfortable,” said Manuel Echavarria, an English teacher who worked at Berwind for 13 years.On Vieques, Ismael Guadalupe Ortiz, 75, has struggled to get treatment for his chronic kidney issues. The ferry to the main island is unreliable and overrun with tourists who get first dibs.“Most of the people of Vieques don’t take care of their health because they have problems with the transportation,” Mr. Guadalupe Ortiz said.Mr. Surillo, the Yabucoa mayor, estimated that residents in his city had abandoned 200 to 300 homes while waiting for help from FEMA. About 50 other houses are occupied, with blue tarps to keep out the rain. About 85 bridges need repairs.“We received a little bit of money for single debris pickup, but when it comes to permanent work, not a penny,” he said.The recovery efforts are more visible in the schools of the Virgin Islands, but they are far from where residents thought they would be two years ago. Children on St. Croix attend classes in trailers that from the inside are hard to differentiate from a typical classroom. But school gyms and music halls — some with collapsed roofs, others festering with mold — remain closed.Students at St. Croix Central High School have complained of skin rashes from the mold, said Mr. Abraham, the school’s principal. Teachers have threatened legal action over their unsanitary work conditions.He doubted that they would still be forced to work in those conditions if they were on the mainland.
President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the United States government had nothing to do with an alleged incursion into Venezuela that landed two US citizens behind bars in the crisis-stricken South American country.Trump said he had just learned of the detention of the pair, accused by Venezuela of being mercenaries. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said they were part of an operation to kill him that was backed by neighbouring Colombia and the US.More:Venezuela says eight killed in foiled 'invasion by sea'US indicts Venezuela's Maduro on 'narco-terrorism' chargesOpposition leader Guaido returns to Venezuela after tour"Whatever it is, we'll let you know," Trump told reporters in Washington, DC, before departing from the White House to Arizona. "But it has nothing to do with our government."Maduro said: "The United States government is fully and completely involved in this defeated raid" and praised members of a fishing village for cornering one group and netting the "professional American mercenaries".US Defense Secretary Mark Esper echoed Trump's comments later on Tuesday, saying "The United States government had nothing to do with what's happened in Venezuela in the last few days."Authorities in Venezuela identified the two detained men as Luke Denman and Airan Berry, both former US special forces soldiers associated with the Florida-based private security firm Silvercorp USA.A third US ex-Green Beret and Silvercorp founder, Jordan Goudreau, claimed responsibility for leading "Operation Gideon", which was launched with an attempted beach landing before dawn on Sunday that left eight suspected attackers dead.The two former US soldiers were detained on Monday dozens of kilometres from the first attempted beach landing in a fishing village. Authorities say they confiscated equipment and detained dozens of others.'Shoestring budget'Goudreau said the operation was designed to capture - and not kill Maduro. He said he carried it out on a "shoestring budget" after signing an agreement with US-backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who Goudreau accuses of failing to pay him. Guaido denies having any relationship with Goudreau.Venezuela is gripped by a deepening social, politico and economic crises under Maduro's rule that has led nearly five million residents to flee crumbling social services, such as unreliable water, electricity and broken hospitals.The US is among nearly 60 countries that back Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader. Guaido invoked the constitution more than a year ago and declared himself interim president. Maduro, who maintains the backing of China, Russia and most of Venezuela's state institutions, including the military, accused Guaido and the US as staging a coup at the time.Venezuela and the US broke diplomatic ties a year ago, so there is no US embassy operating in Venezuela's capital of Caracas."It shocks me how insane they were," said Mike Vigil, the former head of international operations for the Drug Enforcement Administration. "They walked right into a coiled rattlesnake without even having minimally studied the capacity of the Venezuelan armed forces. There's no way the US government would've supported an operation like this."Guaido - often derided by Maduro as a US puppet - has cast doubt on the government's version of Sunday's events."They're trying to create a state of apparent confusion, an effort to hide what's happening in Venezuela," Guaido said in a virtual session of Congress on Tuesday, citing gasoline shortages, a deadly prison riot and a violent gang battle in Caracas. The Venezuelan government is also struggling to cope with the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. 
DataRobot, a company best known for creating automated machine learning models known as AutoML, announced today that it intends to acquire Paxata, a data prep platform startup. The companies did not reveal the purchase price.Paxata  raised a total of $90 million before today’s acquisition, according to the company.Up until now, DataRobot  has concentrated mostly on the machine learning and data science aspect of the workflow — building and testing the model, then putting it into production. The data prep was left to other vendors like Paxata, but DataRobot, which raised $206 million in September, saw an opportunity to fill in a gap in their platform with Paxata.“We’ve identified, because we’ve been focused on machine learning for so long, a number of key data prep capabilities that are required for machine learning to be successful. And so we see an opportunity to really build out a unique and compelling data prep for machine learning offering that’s powered by the Paxata product, but takes the knowledge and understanding and the integration with the machine learning platform from DataRobot,” Phil Gurbacki, SVP of product development and customer experience at DataRobot, told TechCrunch.Prakash Nanduri, CEO and co-founder at Paxata, says the two companies were a great fit and it made a lot of sense to come together. “DataRobot has got a significant number of customers, and every one of their customers have a data and information management problem. For us, the deal allows us to rapidly increase the number of customers that are able to go from data to value. By coming together, the value to the customer is increased at an exponential level,” he explained.DataRobot is based in Boston, while Paxata is in Redwood City, Calif. The plan moving forward is to make Paxata a west coast office, and all of the company’s almost 100 employees will become part of DataRobot when the deal closes.While the two companies are working together to integrate Paxata more fully into the DataRobot platform, the companies also plan to let Paxata continue to exist as a standalone product.DataRobot has raised more than $431 million, according to PitchBook data. It raised $206 million of that in its last round. At the time, the company indicated it would be looking for acquisition opportunities when it made sense.This match-up seems particularly good, given how well the two companies’ capabilities complement one another, and how much customer overlap they have. The deal is expected to close before the end of the year.
It's officially last call for Kathie Lee Gifford.Her time as co-host of the fourth hour of "Today," "Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda," has come to a close after nearly 11 years.In her final words, Gifford referenced a Bible verse. “Jeremiah 29 says, 'I know the plans I have (for) you, declares the Lord,' " she said, getting choked up, " 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a future and a hope.' That’s not just true for me, you guys, that's true for everybody watching."Trust Him. Let Him love you like He wants to love you," she continued. "Like I am loved by all of you."Gifford's hour-long farewell included special guests and musical acts. Of course Gifford and her morning show partner Hoda Kotb celebrated with a drink, dubbed the farewell fizz made with champagne, which was appropriate to pop after they gave the entire studio audience a free cruise from Carnival.The show tugged at Gifford's heartstrings with a recorded sit-down with her children, Cody, 29 (present during his mom's final show) and Cassidy, 25, who Gifford explained was working."To you, mom is a TV legend. To us, she's a legendary mom," Cody said. Cassidy said she looks up to her mom for "her heart, her kindness," adding: "She’s one of the kindest people on the planet.”The children also reflected on their late father Frank Gifford's affection for their mom.Cody recalled "how proud he was of her.""In the last couple years before our dad passed away (in 2015), if I was ever home and we were sitting, watching Mom at 10 a.m. he used to just always say – first, he would say, 'Boy, you're mom's so pretty,' and then he used to always say, 'You know there's no one else like her.' "Cody and Cassidy, appropriately, ended the video by clinking their wine glasses.An emotional Gifford hugged her son in the audience."Thank you," she told him. "I love you."“I done now, I’m done!” Gifford then declared, rejoining Kotb on stage.“Today” staff members then joined Kotb and Gifford on stage for a toast as she delivered her last thoughts.At the top of the show, Flo Rida performed "Sweet sensation" and modified his song "My House" to "Kathie Lee's House." Gifford then said she felt "great" and reflected on why the show has worked. She reasoned it's because they "have fun and we have a friendship and it's real and we have a great love and affection and respect for our audience."We know you guys are sick of bad news by the time you turn our show on in the morning," she added. When Gifford asked her partner why the show has worked, Kotb said, "I think it's because of you," pointing out there's a commonality between the success of their show and "Live with Regis and Kathie Lee," which Gifford hosted with Regis Philbin from 1985 to 2000.Philbin popped up in a recorded message, talking about the wonderful times the two shared. "Kathie Lee you want to know the best part of my life — my TV life — was in the in the 15 years I spent with you,” he said. “We stayed friends through the entire game, and it was a lot of fun. Where you are right now, I know you’re going to be moving on to a great new career making movies, and since I’ve seen the first one, I know you’re gonna be a great success."He added: "I want you to know how I will always remember the great times that we had working together and how you are as a person.”The morning also included games like a trivia showdown hosted by John Cena, which revealed "approximately how many glasses of wine have been served on this show in 11 years": 5,300. Everyone's favorite blue eyeglass model Al Roker lead a game of "The Masked Audience," where mystery guests were in costume like Fox's "The Masked Singer."Gifford was quick to guess Dean Cain's identity, dressed as a fox. The chicken, actor Ryan Eggold, proved more difficult to solve.Barry Manilow flew from Las Vegas to surprise Gifford, though he wore no costume. He performed "Can't Smile Without You," which Gifford joined him for.During the 7 o'clock hour "Today," co-anchor Savannah Guthrie said. "I can't take it this week. Every other minute, I'm crying.""Today" also revisited Kotb and Gifford's first day on the job. "We really don't know one another very well," Gifford said on their debut. "And, I had a good feeling about you, obviously.""We had this great, long lunch and sort of sealed the deal," she added. "If you can go to the ladies room with somebody and cry... and bond, you know you have a good future together."More: Kathie Lee Gifford talks 'crippling loneliness' of losing her husband and motherGifford spoke with USA TODAY of her departure last week, explaining she wanted to focus on movies."It’s not that I wanted to leave the 'Today' show," she said. "I just had to leave if I wanted to actually fulfill lifetime dreams I have that I’m running out of time for."She has been at Kotb's side for nearly 11 years, a decade longer than she'd planned. She said she "came kicking and screaming" to the morning show she revealed she'd be leaving in December. Her late husband, football player turned sports commentator Frank Gifford, persuaded her to give it a year. "By that time I’d fallen in love with Hoda, and a couple of years in I was in love with everybody that I worked with there," Gifford said. "Nicest group of people I’ve ever, ever worked with."For her second morning show exit, Gifford predicted she wouldn't be crying hysterically. "I certainly won’t bawl like a baby," she said. "I’ve been in this business too long, and it’s not like I’m dying, and it’s not like I’m never gonna see these lovely people ever again. I’m leaving one particular job and one particular building for something that I’ve been wanting to do my whole life, and I have so much to look forward to. So it’s not a sad thing for me."NBC announced Jenna Bush Hager would be Gifford's replacement in late February.

Gay and bisexual men have reportedly been told they cannot donate their plasma to coronavirus trials at a London hospital.A potential treatment for Covid-19 using plasma from recovered patients is to be trialled by doctors at Guy's and St Thomas' hospital.It is hoped the potential treatment, known as convalescent plasma, will help patients whose bodies are not producing sufficient antibodies to fight the virus.But according to current Department of Health guidelines, any man who has had sex with another man within the past three months is excluded from donating their plasma.The guidelines state: "Men who have sex with men are at an increased risk of acquiring certain infections through sex", which could be passed on during a transfusion.It comes as critical care manager Andy Roberts told ITV News that he was turned down for the plasma trial, after testing positive for Covid-19."It only goes to show that in the UK being gay is still thought as a form of contamination, so if you’re straight and sleep with a different person every weekend it’s safer," he said.The guidelines around donating blood are set by the Department of Health on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs.They are implemented by the NHS Blood and Transplant service.A spokesman for the service told the Standard: “We will initially be using the current donor selection guidelines although we will keep this under review."The guidelines are there to protect the health of the donor and the recipient."Under the current guidelines, men must wait three months after having oral or anal sex with another man. We appreciate this deferral can feel disappointing if you want to save lives."Separately to the convalescent plasma trial, we are working with LGBT+ groups to explore whether we might be able to introduce a more individualised risk assessment for blood donation.” 
Top US health official Anthony Fauci  has said that there is no scientific evidence to support claims by Donald Trump that the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab. Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been one of the leading medical experts helping to guide the US response to the highly contagious virus that has swept across the country.Dr Fauci contradicted claims made by the US president that the global coronavirus pandemic started in a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan in an interview published on Monday evening by National Geographic. "If you look at the evolution of the virus in bats and what's out there now, (the scientific evidence) is very, very strongly leaning toward this could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated," Fauci told the magazine."Everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that (this virus) evolved in nature and then jumped species," he said.The well-regarded doctor has at times corrected or contradicted the president at White House briefings or in press interviews on issues such as the time required to develop a vaccine and the likelihood that the coronavirus will return in the fall.The World Health Organization also said on Monday that Washington had provided nothing to support "speculative" claims that a Wuhan lab was to blame for the outbreak."We have not received any data or specific evidence from the United States government relating to the purported origin of the virus - so from our perspective, this remains speculative," WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual briefing.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison also said in comments on Tuesday that the most likely origin of the virus was a Chinese wet market, appearing to contradict Trump's claims.Scientists believe the killer virus jumped from animals to humans, emerging in China late last year, possibly from a market in Wuhan selling exotic animals for meat.Mr Trump, increasingly critical of China's management of the outbreak, claims to have proof it started in a Wuhan laboratory.And US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday said "enormous evidence" backed up that claim, although the US intelligence community last week said it would continue to study whether the outbreak stemmed from infected animal contact, or a lab accident.China has vehemently denied suggestions the lab was the source."Like any evidence-based organisation, we would be very willing to receive any information that purports to the origin of the virus," Mr Ryan said, stressing that this was a very important piece of public health information for future control."If that data and evidence is available, then it will be for the United States government to decide whether and when it can be shared, but it is difficult for the WHO to operate in an information vacuum in that regard," he added. 
The U.S. economy grew at a moderate 2.1% rate over the summer, slightly faster than first estimated. But many economists say they think growth is slowing sharply in the current quarter.The Commerce Department says the July-September growth rate in the gross domestic product, the economy’s total output of goods and services slightly exceeded its initial estimate of a 1.9% rate.The economy had begun the year with a sizzling 3.1% GDP rate. Many economists have estimated that GDP growth is weakening in the current quarter to as slow as a sub-1% annual rate, largely because the U.S.-China trade war has led businesses to cut investment and inventories.Still, the holiday shopping season is expected to be relatively healthy given solid job growth and consumer spending.
WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump attacked 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday for being named Time magazine's "Person of The Year.""So ridiculous," Trump said on Twitter. "Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!"Thunberg responded swiftly, changing her Twitter profile to read: "A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend."Trump, who was named Person of the Year after winning the 2016 presidential election, has criticized the magazine before for passing him up in the years since.Later Thursday, Trump’s 2020 campaign tweeted an edited cover of Time’s "Person of the Year" cover which superimposed the president’s head on Thunberg’s body, claiming that “When it comes to keeping his promises, there's only one Person Of The Year.” Trump mocked Thunberg back in September, when both were in New York City for meetings at the United Nations.Citing lines from Thunberg's address to the Climate Action Summit – the teenager said "people are dying" and "we are in the beginning of a mass extinction" – Trump issued a late-night snarky tweet."She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future," Trump wrote. "'So nice to see!"Thunberg dismissed Trump's comments, and said later she wouldn't consider meeting with the U.S. president on the issue of climate change."I don’t understand why I would do that," Thunberg said last month on  "The Ellen DeGeneres Show." "I don’t see what I could tell him that he hasn’t already heard, and I just think it would be a waste of time, really."Thunberg has spoken about her diagnosis of Asperger's, a neurological disorder that creates difficulty with social and communications skills. She calls it her "superpower."'In naming her Person of the Year, Time magazine said "Thunberg began a global movement by skipping school: starting in August 2018, she spent her days camped out in front of the Swedish Parliament, holding a sign painted in black letters on a white background that read Skolstrejk för klimatet: “School Strike for Climate.”It added: "In the 16 months since, she has addressed heads of state at the U.N., met with the Pope, sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike on September 20, 2019, in what was the largest climate demonstration in human history."On social media, critics described Trump's tweet as equivalent to bullying a child."The President of the United States is attacking a child," tweeted former federal prosecutor and legal commentator Renato Mariotti.Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, now a fierce critic of Trump, called him "a bully and a punk" for attacking Thunberg."No normal person would find this sort of behavior tolerable," he tweeted. "Much less from a global leader. @realDonaldTrump is a despicable person."
Google  Cloud today announced Transfer Service, a new service for enterprises that want to move their data from on-premise systems to the cloud. This new managed service is meant for large-scale transfers on the scale of billions of files and petabytes of data. It complements similar services from Google that allow you to ship data to its data centers via a hardware appliance and FedEx or to automate data transfers from SaaS applications to Google’s BigQuery service.Transfer Service handles all of the hard work of validating your data’s integrity as it moves to the cloud. The agent automatically handles failures and uses as much available bandwidth as it can to reduce transfer times.To do this, all you have to do is install an agent on your on-premises servers, select the directories you want to copy and let the service do its job. You can then monitor and manage your transfer jobs from the Google Cloud console.The obvious use case for this is archiving and disaster recovery. But Google is also targeting companies that are looking to lift and shift workloads (and their attached data), as well as analytics and machine learning use cases.As with most of Google Cloud’s recent product launches, the focus here is squarely on enterprise customers. Google wants to make it easier for them to move their workloads to its cloud, and for most workloads, that also involves moving lots of data as well.
The US government has distributed about 130 million economic impact payments to taxpayers in less than 30 days. The IRS anticipates sending more than 150 million payments as part of a massive coronavirus rescue package.The distribution has had some hiccups, including an overwhelmed website, payments to deceased taxpayers and money sent to inactive accounts.For those still waiting or with other questions, here are a few answers:Where is my payment?The government can’t logistically or physically make all the payments at once, so it’s doing so in steps.For those with direct deposit information on file with the IRS, based 2019 or 2018 tax return, payments began going out April 10.Payments started going out last week to Social Security beneficiaries, railroad retirees and veterans who aren’t required to file a tax return; these will continue through May. Individuals in this group will get their relief by the same method they receive their other benefits, be that direct deposit or mail.Others who are not required to file tax returns, such as low-income individuals, were encouraged to file basic information on the IRS website. Without this information, the government cannot issue a payment.Anyone who is eligible but does not have direct deposit information on file will be mailed a check. Those began to go out in late April, but that process might take several months because of distribution limitations.All payments were prioritized in order from lowest income to highest income.So, first make sure you’re eligible for a payment. If you qualify, make sure the IRS has the current and necessary information. The IRS has a Get My Payment tool on its website for people to add their direct deposit information or track the status of their payment.Why doesn’t the IRS Get My Payment tool work for me?The IRS has fixed some glitches with Get My Payment since the rollout. The experience may still not be perfect.Some taxpayers say they still cannot get past the first step of entering their basic information — name, address and adjusted gross income. The information entered must exactly match that on tax returns. Look closely for minor differences, such as spelling out Street instead of abbreviating it.Several users said they had success with putting the address in all caps, as suggested by the LA Times. The IRS says, however, that the entry line is not case sensitive. It did say removing all punctuation may help.If these fail, consider using 2018 tax return data.A word of warning: Three unsuccessful attempts to log on in one day will leave a user locked out for 24 hours as a security precaution.Why am I getting error messages on the Get My Payment tool?The “Payment Status Not Available” response has vexed many users.It means the IRS cannot determine your eligibility right now. There are a few reasons for this. First, you didn’t file a 2018 or 2019 return, or it hasn’t been fully processed. Or the site simply doesn’t have the information available yet; the agency is adding more data for use every day. It updates the information overnight daily.My dead relative got a payment. Can I keep it?It’s unclear.President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have said that these payments should be returned to the government. However, the IRS has yet to issue formal guidance, saying it’s aware of the problem and working to resolve it. Experts say because of a lag in reporting data on who is deceased, the error is almost inevitable and has occurred with past stimulus payments as well.I didn’t get a payment for my child. Why?The $500 payments only go to eligible children, generally those 16 and under. You might not get the payment if someone else can claim them as a dependent or if they’re not reflected on your most recent tax return, such as a newborn child.People who receive Supplemental Security Income or Department of Veterans Affairs benefits also don’t automatically get payments for dependents. They must add that information on the IRS website by Tuesday to get payment.If you did not receive the full amount to which you believe you’re entitled, for a child or otherwise, you’ll be able to claim the additional amount on your 2020 tax return.I don’t use (or don’t recognize) the bank account my payment went to. What now?If the account is closed or no longer active, the bank will reject the deposit and mail a check instead. It will go either to the address listed on your tax returns or the one on file with the U.S. Postal Service, whichever is most current.This is a common problem for people who got a refund anticipation loan, refund anticipation check or had their refund loaded onto a prepaid debit card. In these cases, the relief payment may have been directed to the real or virtual account associated with the product. But again, if the account is closed or inactive, it will be rejected and a check will be mailed.The IRS has corrected an earlier online error, which told users that some rejected payments were being sent to the same account a second time; they are not and will be mailed.What if I have issues?The IRS will send a letter to taxpayers about 15 days after a payment is sent letting them know how it was made and how to report issues.It also has many answers online and is updating its site regularly.If you still need a real person, you’ll have to wait. The IRS had been unable to staff its telephone lines because of the pandemic. Employees only began to return to the agency last week and it’s unclear when many services will be back up. 
Small-satellite startup Kepler Communications  is teaming up with SpaceX  to make good on its deployment goals for its first nanosatellite constellation. SpaceX will carry two separate batches of nanosatellites from Kepler aboard its Falcon 9 launch vehicles.Kepler Communications, a Toronto-based space startup, will be building out a low-power, direct IoT connectivity satellite-based network, as well as a more high-capacity network powered with the same satellites to provide high-speed data transfer capabilities.In total, Kepler will launch 400 kg (around 880 lbs) of payload with SpaceX, making use of the rideshare program that the Elon Musk-run company announced earlier this year. This launch will put the Kepler spacecraft into Sun-synchronous orbit, which means that they will pass over specific points on Earth at the same time each day as judged by the Sun’s position.All told, Kepler will aim to put a total of 140 satellites in orbit across three phases of launch spanning 2020 to 2023. The goal is to operate the constellation as a relay system to help transfer data to other satellite constellations in orbit.
You might be surprised what you can buy on Facebook, if you know where to look. Researchers with Cisco’s Talos security research team have uncovered a wave of Facebook groups dedicated to making money from a variety of illicit and otherwise sketchy online behaviors, including phishing schemes, trading hacked credentials and spamming. The 74 groups researchers detected boasted a cumulative 385,000 members.Remarkably, the groups weren’t even really trying to conceal their activities. For example, Talos found posts openly selling credit card numbers with three-digit CVV codes, some with accompanying photos of the card’s owner. According to the research group:The majority of these groups use fairly obvious group names, including “Spam Professional,” “Spammer & Hacker Professional,” “Buy Cvv On THIS SHOP PAYMENT BY BTC 💰💵,” and “Facebook hack (Phishing).” Despite the fairly obvious names, some of these groups have managed to remain on Facebook for up to eight years, and in the process acquire tens of thousands of group members.Beyond the sale of stolen credentials, Talos documented users selling shell accounts for governments and organizations, promoting their expertise in moving large sums of money and offering to create fake passports and other identifying documents.The new research isn’t the first time that Facebook users have been busted for dealing in cybercrime. In 2018, Brian Krebs reported 120 groups with a cumulative 300,000-plus members engaged in similar activities, including phishing schemes, spamming, botnets and on-demand DDoS attacks.As Talos researchers explain in their blog post, “Months later, though the specific groups identified by Krebs had been permanently disabled, Talos discovered a new set of groups, some having names remarkably similar, if not identical, to the groups reported on by Krebs.”“While some groups were removed immediately, other groups only had specific posts removed,” Talos researcher Jaeson Schultz wrote. “Eventually, through contact with Facebook’s security team, the majority of malicious groups was quickly taken down, however new groups continue to pop up, and some are still active as of the date of publishing.”Cybercrime groups are yet another example of the game of enforcement whack-a-mole that Facebook continues to play on its massive platform. At the social network’s scale — and without the company dedicating sufficient resources to more comprehensive detection methods — it’s difficult for Facebook to track the kinds of illicit or potentially harmful behaviors that flourish in unmonitored corners of its sprawling platform.“These groups violated our policies against spam and financial fraud and we removed them,” a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We know we need to be more vigilant and we’re investing heavily to fight this type of activity.”
Men with advanced prostate cancer can take highly targeted hormone therapies at home instead of coming into hospital for chemotherapy, NHS England says.Experts say it will relieve pressure on the NHS, which wants all urgent and essential cancer treatments to continue during the coronavirus pandemic.The drugs are also smarter, kinder treatments and could extend the lives of many more patients, they say.This precision-medicine approach is already used to treat other cancers.'Huge shock'Diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in February, Stuart Fraser, 66, from Ashtead, in Surrey, will now take four enzalutamide tablets a day."Being diagnosed was a huge shock," he said."What made it even more worrying was that, because of coronavirus, I was told I couldn't have the usual treatment of chemotherapy, which would have affected my immune system."When I heard about other possible treatments like abiraterone and enzalutamide, I launched a petition to try to make sure men like me could get hold of it."That's why it's such great news that now no-one will be in the same position I was at the beginning of all this."Enzalutamide blocks the effect of the testosterone hormone on prostate-cancer cells, preventing them from growing.Patients intolerant to enzalutamide, will be given abiraterone, which stops the body producing testosterone.Until now, in England and Wales, the drugs were available only to patients for whom other hormone therapy had stopped working, although abiraterone was recommended in Scotland as a first-line treatment earlier this year.Now, doctors can prescribe them when a patient is first diagnosed.'Hard-pressed hospitals'Prof Nick James, of the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, who has led major trials into targeted prostate cancer drugs, said: "I'm pleased and relieved that many more men should now benefit from targeted hormone therapies right from when they are first diagnosed."It will greatly lower the risk of exposing vulnerable patients to the coronavirus and lightens the load on our hard-pressed hospitals."Men can take their tablets at home and have their bloods checked by their GP."And, unlike chemotherapy, enzalutamide and abiraterone have no significant effects on patients' immune system."National clinical director for cancer Prof Peter Johnson said: "The NHS has been working hard to ensure the safety of cancer patients during the pandemic."Switching from chemotherapy to hormone treatments for prostate cancer is just one example of how we are adapting our approach to help thousands of cancer patients across the country continue to access the care they need." 
Cities can play a major role in the global effort to curb climate change, a new report says—and a major step they can take is helping their inhabitants consume a whole lot less stuff by making changes in the way cities are run.Even the most forward-thinking cities have a long way to go to neutralise their carbon emissions, the report says. That’s partly because for years, cities have been doing carbon math wrong, adding up only the carbon costs that occur within city limits. But much of city dwellers' climate impact actually comes from the things they eat, use, or buy that originate far outside the city—from food to clothes to electronics and more.To keep emissions in check, the report suggests, cities should aim to trim their carbon emissions by 50 percent in the next 11 years, and then by a total of 80 percent by 2050. And because, as the researchers found, a hefty portion of those emissions can be traced back to consumer goods, food, and energy produced outside city limits, one of the best things cities can do is help their residents pull back on consumption.That’s a big challenge but also a big opportunity, says Mark Watts, the lead author of the report and executive director of the C40 city network, an international network of cities committed to addressing climate issues.“Halving emissions in the next 10 years--that’s what needs to happen, and cities see that,” he says. “Now, it’s time to move onto the next stage, because we’re already in a climate emergency, and [to] figure out how does government have to change in order to hit that target?”The true costToday, some 55 percent of all humans live in urban areas, where they account for about 70 percent of all annual carbon emissions. In the future, demographers predict, even more of Earth’s population will likely congregate in cities, hitting about 70 percent by 2050. If nothing changes, carbon emissions from cities is on track to almost double by 2050, the report says. And as cities’ carbon emissions go up, so do the planet’s.For years, many cities sold themselves as bastions of efficient, low-carbon living. To some extent, that’s true. Densely packed neighbourhoods, good public transit systems, and green buildings all help to keep their inhabitants’ carbon impacts in check. (Read about what sustainable cities of the future might look like).But city dwellers—especially those in wealthy cities in developed countries—tend to buy more, fly more, and use a lot more energy than people who live in rural areas. All the things they buy—from the clothes to the food to the electronics and more—have their own complicated and often substantial planetary costs that aren’t always immediately obvious.A t-shirt, for example, might get made of cotton grown in India; be manufactured in China using coal energy to power the sewing machines; packed up in yet another country with oil-based plastic packaging; shipped across oceans in fossil-fuel-fired container ships; and delivered by diesel truck to the store in which they’re sold.A real assessment of someone’s carbon footprint takes the carbon footprint of these “consumed” products into account. And when city dwellers’ consumption habits are added up, it turns out that urbanites have a carbon toll about 60 percent higher than previous calculations suggested. City dwellers in 96 of the world’s biggest cities alone make up a hefty 10 percent of all global carbon emissions each year.“People tend to forget that most of the products we consume and our personal carbon footprints are imported from elsewhere to give us a great life in the modern cities we live in,” says Jeroen van der Heijden, an expert on climate and government at Victoria University in New Zealand.“If we truly want to make a meaningful contribution to cutting carbon emissions, we must do much better than building green houses. We have to rethink how we live and what we consume.”The road ahead is paved with less stuffNational governments and international communities have struggled to take meaningful steps toward addressing carbon emissions. In many cases, cities have stepped in to fill that role, developing ambitious climate action plans that seek to curb emissions.The C40 network cities have collectively pledged to limit their carbon emissions to levels that will help keep the planet from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), the upper limit of warming the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently warned against exceeding.To get there, the report suggests cities can nudge behaviours in six key areas: food, construction and building, clothing, vehicles and transportation, aviation, and consumer electronics from washing machines to computers to phones.For example, cities are often already major food purchasers; they buy for schools, city organisations, and more. That means that they can influence emissions by changing their buying practices.New York schools are starting a “Meatless Mondays” program in 2019 that the city says will reduce its citizens' carbon footprint and make kids healthier. Other cities, like Milan, have put programs in place to help local agriculture thrive, reducing the carbon costs from transporting foods long distances.It turns out that city dwellers also buy a lot of clothes, and the carbon impact of those jeans and sweaters piles up. If people bought only eight new clothing items each year, the report says, they could cut that impact in half.Cities can also take action to reduce the amount of energy their denizens use by doing things like tweaking building codes to encourage retrofits of buildings rather than new construction; prioritising low-carbon transportation options that keep people from buying new cars or motorbikes; and setting up programs that help people extend the lifetime of their electronics and appliances rather than constantly replacing them. Every intervention that helps people buy less new stuff adds up, pushing a city's emissions down.The transformations have to happen in a way that cuts from the individual consumer all the way up to the big players like the utilities who serve a city, says Patricia Romero-Lankao, an expert on cities and the environment at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado.“Yes indeed we need to change the way we use energy, heat houses, think of our sense of comfort—which is a cultural thing—buy clothes, all that,” she says. “But we really also need to work with the utilities, the corporations, the big players whose products we’re using.”But the biggest transformation is about a mindset, says Watts, of C40. “We’re talking about a really radical change in consumption patterns,” he says, moving toward a world where there is much less buying, less building, and less waste. “But the benefits really are huge. Avoiding the climate crisis really does mean building a much better life.”
A close ally of Boris Johnson has resigned as a minister after being found to have used his position to try to intimidate a member of the public.The international trade minister, Conor Burns, was found by the standards committee to have made a series of veiled threats while attempting to intervene in his father’s dispute over a loan.The committee recommended a suspension from parliament over multiple breaches of the MPs’ code before No 10 announced his resignation. A Downing Street spokesman said Burns had resigned after the committee’s report.The commissioner for standards received a complaint from a member of the public connected to a firm with which Burns’s father was in dispute over the repayment of a loan. The complaint centred on a letter sent by Burns, which claimed his father had made extensive attempts over a period of years to reach a settlement on repayment of that loan.In the letter, written in February 2019 on House of Commons notepaper, Burns stated he was writing on his father’s behalf enclosing an earlier letter sent by his father to the company to which, he stated, no response had been received.“I am acutely aware that my role in the public eye could well attract interest especially if I were to use parliamentary privilege to raise the case (on which I have taken advice from the house authorities),” Burns wrote.The MP suggested the complainant, a former senior civil servant whose name was redacted from House of Commons documents, could avoid having him raise the case in the Commons by securing the payment of the loan to his father.Burns noted the complainant’s “high-profile role” outside the company “could well add to that attention”. By raising the case during parliamentary proceedings, Burns’s words would have been protected from a legal challenge by parliamentary privilege.When confronted by Kathryn Stone, the commissioner for standards, Burns said he had not sought formal advice. Stone said his behaviour “gives fuel to the belief that members are able and willing to use the privileges accorded them by their membership of the house to benefit their own personal interests”.“The content of the letter suggests the use of the principal emblem of the house was more deliberate than accidental. And, as I explained in my letter to Mr Burns of 11 June 2019, his reference to having sought advice about privilege from the house authorities was misleading,” Stone wrote.The report released by the standards committee found that he had also misused parliamentary-headed notepaper. It accused Burns of behaving “disrespectfully” during the investigation and of claiming he had not received a memo from Stone over several months.The cross-party committee recommended he should apologise in writing to the Commons and to the individual concerned – a recommendation that will need to be signed off by the Commons.“The right of members of parliament to speak in the chamber without fear or favour is essential to parliament’s ability to scrutinise the executive and to tackle social abuses, particularly if the latter are committed by the rich and powerful who might use the threat of defamation proceedings to deter legitimate criticism.“Precisely because parliamentary privilege is so important, it is essential to maintaining public respect for parliament that the protection afforded by privilege should not be abused by a member in the pursuit of their purely private and personal interests,” the report said.Burns, 47, was made a trade minister in July when Johnson became Conservative leader and was a key member of his campaign team. He was elected to represent Bournemouth West in 2010 and defended his seat in 2015, 2017 and 2019.He served as parliamentary private secretary to Johnson when he was foreign secretary but resigned from the post in July 2018.Burns expressed his regret in a tweet on Monday. “With deep regret I have decided to resign as Minister of State for International Trade. @BorisJohnson will continue to have my wholehearted support from the backbenches,” he said.In a separate development, another minister at the Department for International Trade, Greg Hands, was ordered on Monday to apologise for misusing parliamentary stationery to send a letter to thousands of constituents.In October 2019, the Chelsea and Fulham MP had told the commissioner he was willing to publicly acknowledge he had breached the rules, apologise and reimburse the £4,865 costs. But with the election looming, Hands changed his mind.The committee said: “It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Mr Hands may well have been motivated by a desire to avoid the embarrassment of having to make a public apology for breaking parliamentary rules during a general election campaign.”  
If you think about it, the basic concept of a toothbrush hasn’t evolved since… forever. Sure, many people have switched to an electric toothbrush, but it remains a stick with a brush at the end.Willo thinks that’s not good enough. The company has developed an oral care device to improve brushing with a focus on plaque. The company says that basic brushing only cleans 42% of dental plaque, while electric brushes clean 46% of dental plaque.The startup has worked with dentists to design its product. It still sounds a bit mysterious, as the company isn’t sharing much about the product. The photo above is the only image of the product right now.But what we do know is that the startup has raised a $7.5 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins,  with Bpifrance and Nest co-founder Matt Rogers also participating. The company was founded by Hugo de Gentile, Ilan Abehassera and Jean-Marie de Gentile, and it attended The Refiners accelerator program.Now let’s see how it actually works, how much it costs and if people are willing to change everything about the way they brush their teeth.
Fifteen books were recognized as winners or finalists for the Pulitzer Prize on Monday, in the categories of fiction, general history, biography, poetry and general nonfiction.FictionWinner: “The Nickel Boys,” by Colson WhiteheadIn his latest novel, the “Underground Railroad” writer fictionalized the story of a Florida school where dozens of black boys were tortured and buried in a secret graveyard. “Were Whitehead’s only aim to shine an unforgiving light on a redacted chapter of racial terrorism in the American chronicle, that would be achievement enough,” wrote our reviewer. But Whitehead “applies a master storyteller’s muscle not just to excavating a grievous past but to examining the process by which Americans undermine, distort, hide or ‘neatly erase’ the stories he is driven to tell.”Finalist: “The Dutch House,” by Ann PatchettThis novel explores the dynamics of a blended family living in a glass house outside Philadelphia in midcentury. “I can’t pluck out one sentence worth quoting, but how effective they are when woven together — these translucent lines that envelop you like a spider’s web,” wrote our reviewer. “It can feel old-fashioned: her style, her attachment to a very traditional kind of storytelling,” but “like the family’s Dutch house, it’s an enduring structure, which gives an added dimension to the references in the text — its way of gesturing toward a lineage.”Finalist: “The Topeka School,” by Ben LernerLerner’s “exhilarating” novel, also selected by the Book Review as one of the 10 best books of 2019, features a familiar protagonist to his readers, Adam Gordon, this time as a high school student. Lerner’s questions about art and authenticity are carried through to this book, but in “The Topeka School,” “Adam’s faithlessness can no longer be written off as cosmopolitan neurosis. It is instead a symptom of a national crisis of belief, in which structures of understanding crumble and ‘regimes of meaning collapse into the spread.’”HistoryWinner: “Sweet Taste of Liberty: A True Story of Slavery and Restitution in America,” by W. Caleb McDanielThis book explores reparations through the story of a 19th-century woman who sued her captor after surviving a kidnapping and re-enslavement. Her story, wrote McDaniel in an Opinion piece for The Times, “offers lessons for today, both about the impact restitution can make and about the limited power of payment alone.”Finalist: “Race for Profit: How Banks and the Real Estate Industry Undermined Black Homeownership,” by Keeanga-Yamahtta TaylorTaylor’s book, also longlisted for the National Book Award, “covers the few years in the late ’60s and early ’70s, when the Fair Housing Act of 1968 nominally ended the government’s longstanding practice of redlining.” Our reviewer wrote that she “meticulously documents what happened next, as the federal government partnered with a real estate industry, enthusiastic about exploiting a new market but refusing to bear most of the risk.”Finalist: “The End of the Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of America,” by Greg GrandinIn this “measured, careful work,” Grandin explores the recently popularized symbol of the border wall in the context of the United States’s historical Western expansion. “Grandin keeps his cool — he prefers the stiletto to the club — but he grows angrier as his history reaches the present day,” wrote our reviewer.BiographyWinner: “Sontag: Her Life and Work,” by Benjamin MoserThis biography of Susan Sontag “is a skilled, lively, prodigiously researched book that, in the main, neither whitewashes nor rebukes its subject: It works hard to make the reader see Sontag as the severely complex person she was,” wrote our reviewer.Finalist: “Our Man: Richard Holbrooke and the End of the American Century,” by George PackerAccording to our reviewer, “Our Man” — a biography as “charming, brilliant, cocksure and exasperating” as its subject, the American diplomat Richard Holbrooke — “isn’t a book you’re supposed to dip into piecemeal, searching for information; it’s best appreciated like a novel, consumed whole.”Finalist: “Parisian Lives: Samuel Beckett, Simone de Beauvoir, And Me,” by Deirdre BairBair’s book “reads much like a ‘making of …’ documentary” in which she “gives us her off-camera take on her first two biographies,” wrote our reviewer. Both Beckett and de Beauvoir agreed to the project, with different levels of participation, and the book delves into the sometimes difficult path of writing about the two figures.PoetryWinner: “The Tradition,” by Jericho BrownIn this project, “Brown creates poetry that is a catalog of injuries past and present, personal and national, in a country where blackness, particularly male blackness, is akin to illness,” wrote our reviewer. “Even as he reckons seriously with our state of affairs, Brown brings a sense of semantic play to blackness, bouncing between different connotations of words to create a racial doublespeak.”Finalist: “Dunce,” by Mary RuefleRuefle “confronts the extraordinary yet banal fact that all of us die,” in this poetry collection. “‘Dunce’ is full of these linguistic reversals — the chiasmus may be the device that best represents life’s reversal of fortune, our built-in obsolescence,” wrote our reviewer.Finalist: “Only as the Day Is Long: New and Selected Poems,” by Dorianne LauxThis collection of poems by a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet includes 20 new pieces that are odes to Laux’s mother. Her work explores sexuality, survival and healing.General NonfictionWinner: “The End of the Myth: From the Frontier to the Border Wall in the Mind of America,” by Greg GrandinWinner: “The Undying: Pain, Vulnerability, Mortality, Medicine, Art, Time, Dreams, Data, Exhaustion, Cancer, and Care,” by Anne Boyer“The End of the Myth” was also a finalist in the history category. In “The Undying,” “the pink ribbon, that ubiquitous emblem of breast cancer awareness, has long been an object of controversy and derision,” wrote our reviewer, but Boyer “doesn’t just pull it loose, unfastening its dainty loop; she feeds it through a shredder and lights it on fire, incinerating its remains.”Finalist: “Elderhood: Redefining Aging, Transforming Medicine, Reimagining Life,” by Louise AronsonIn this book, Aronson, a geriatrician, draws from her 25 years of caring for patients, as well as history, science and popular culture, to paint a humanistic picture of old age.Finalist: “Solitary: Unbroken by Four Decades in Solitary Confinement. My Story of Transformation and Hope,” by Albert Woodfox with Leslie GeorgeThis “uncommonly powerful” memoir details Woodfox’s young life of crime and his time in various prisons, including four decades in solitary confinement for a crime he did not commit. “If the ending of this book does not leave you with tears pooling down in your clavicles, you are a stronger person than I am,” wrote our reviewer. “More lasting is Woodfox’s conviction that the American justice system is in dire need of reform.”
